            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Reader: Moſt graue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth our Communion Booke admoniſh ſuch as come to be married, that they ought to enter into this eſtate, not <hi>raſhly, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, vnaduiſedly, to ſatisfie their carnall luſts and appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, like bruit beaſts, that haue no vnderſtanding; but diſcreetly, aduiſedly, ſoberly, and in the feare of God.</hi> Needful it is, that this counſel be ſounded often in the eares of the vnmarried, and not alone in that inſtant, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are now about to conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate marriage. For want of heeding this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, how common is it, and withall how miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous? For men to offend in an ouer-ſudden and ouer-haſtie vndertaking of Marriage, without the due meditation of two ſpecial things (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what be the duties of Marriage, and what the difficulties,) it is as impoſſible to be well prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for that eſtate, as to flye without wings, to goe without legs, or to ſee without an eye: yet
<pb facs="tcp:8041:3"/>ſcarce one man or woman of a number will put themſelues to the paines of informing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues beforehand, of either of theſe two things. Thus hauing blindly and headlongly caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into marriage, either not at all (or with no firme and ſettled knowledge) knowing, what belongs vnto it, what ſeruices they are called to performe, what burdens to ſuſtaine in it: it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes (as needs it muſt) that with much hazzard to their owne ſoules, and much vnquietneſſe to themſelues, families and neighbours, they proue vtterly careleſſe of their duties, and extremely impatient vnder their croſſes. Hence it comes to paſſe, that marriage prooueth to many, iuſt as the ſtocks vnto the drunkard; into which, when his head was warme with Wine or Ale, hee put his foot laughingly, and with merriment: but a little after (hauing ſlept out his Wine, and coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his head with a nap,) hee longs as much to get it out againe. Hence it is, that diuers houſes are none other, but euen very Fencing-Schooles, wherein the two ſexes ſeeme to haue met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for nothing, but to play their prizes, and to trie maſteries. Hence it is, that many husbands and wiues doe fare almoſt alwayes, as <hi>Iob</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, when the Deuill had ſmitten his body with boyles and vlcers, curſing their Wedding-day, as much as he did his Birth-day, and thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after diuorce as much, as euer hee did after death. Hence it is, that many wedded people brooke their wedlocke in none other faſhion, then a dog doth his Chaine, at which he neuer
<pb facs="tcp:8041:3"/>ceaſeth ſnarling and gnawing, that he may break it aſunder, and ſet himſelfe at libertie. Hence it is, that the little child is no more wearie of his fine new guilded book, now a little ouer-worne &amp; ſullyed (yea, that the priſoner is no more wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his gyues, nor the Gally-ſlaue of his oares) then many an husband of his wife, and ſhee of him, within an yeere or two, and ſometimes within a moneth or two, after their wedding. In a word, from this fountaine, ſuch a ſtreame of bitter waters doe iſſue, as make the liues of a number in marriage, like the ſoiourning of Iſrael in Marah, where almoſt nothing could be heard, but murmuring and complaining. To redreſſe or preuent, if it might be, at leaſt, ſome of theſe many miſchiefes, I haue been bold (as once <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> did caſt a piece of wood into the waters of Marah to ſweeten them, ſo) to publiſh already to the World, ſome few directions about the duties of the married, and doe now aduenture againe, to put forth ſome other aduertiſements, about the troubles of Marriage. Neither let it ſeeme ſuperfluous to giue men tidings of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles before they come, ſeeing they are alwayes ſo much the better borne, by how much they are more expected. Men are indeed deſirous to pleaſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues rather, with the ſweet thoughts of comfort, then to imbitter their minds with fore-fearefull conceits of miſerie. Alſo, to a mind fully bent vpon a courſe, diſſwaſions proue tedious; and hee that foretelleth inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, may ſeeme to diſſwade. But let it be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb facs="tcp:8041:4"/>withall, that likely none doe meete with more croſſes in marriage, or beare their croſſes more vntowardly, then thoſe that moſt dreame of finding it a very Paradiſe: For they ſtrange aboue meaſure at the cumbers they neuer fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought of, and are put out of all patience, by being ſo farre diſappointed, as to find thick mire and dirt there, where they would tell them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of nothing, but faire and pleaſant way. And indeed none ſhew themſelues leſſe reſolute in vnder-going miſerie, then thoſe that make themſelues moſt reſolute to ruſh vpon it. The ſame vices that breed ſtiffeneſſe in ones courſe, will breed impatiency vnder the croſſes that he meetes with in his courſe. Wilfulneſſe and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe, grow like two euill branches, out of one roote of folly. But warineſſe of mind, in foreſeeing, and forefearing euill, brings quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of mind, in bearing and ſuſtaining euill: and the expectation of miſerie makes it, at leaſt, ſeeme lighter, becauſe the mind is ſomewhat acquainted with it by contemplation. When Iſrael would needs haue a King to rule ouer them, as other Nations, the Lord commandeth <hi>Samuel</hi> to teſtifie vnto them, what ſhould bee the manner of their King, and ſo hee tels them, what heauy burdens their much-deſired Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch ſhould lade them withall. No doubt it is as needfull for marrying perſons, to know what burdens their wedded condition is like to bring vpon them. Wherefore I will make bold to foretel thoſe that will enter into Marriage, that
<pb facs="tcp:8041:4"/>they muſt make account in changing their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, to change for the leſſe eaſefull; and will aduiſe him that will follow mine aduice (if not, let him follow his owne mind, and ſay ten yeres after, whether was the better counſell) To goe vnto Matrimonie with feare of the worſt, and to know before-hand, that there grow Briers and Thornes in this way, wheron he muſt needs tread, that will trauaile in it. Yet is not this writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by me, to make any man forbeare marriage, whom God calleth vnto it; nor to make men hazard themſelues to wickedneſſe, for feare of the cumbers of Matrimony: but alone to make thoſe willing to want marriage, that may want it without ſinne, or hazard of ſinne; and to make men careful not to marry, before God cals them to it; and withall, being called, to fit themſelues for it; leſt if they marry ſooner, or with leſſe warines, they diſcredit Marriage after a while, as moſt do that are married, by wiſhing themſelues ſingle againe. Some man, perhaps, vpon occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe words, may deſire to haue this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſatisfied, When doth God call a man to Marriage? I anſwere: Firſt, when he ſets him in ſuch a condition, that he may marry, without wronging any other perſon, that is, when hee is now become his owne man, not bound by coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to continue another mans ſeruant: for God neuer croſſeth himſelfe: whom he hath called for a certaine time to bee ſeruant vnto a Maſter, him he doth not call, during that time, to breake from that ſeruice, without his Maſters liking;
<pb facs="tcp:8041:5"/>and to thinke of making himſelfe a Maſter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he haue fulfilled the dutie of a ſeruant. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, when God furniſheth a man with ſome conuenient meanes to maintaine a Wife and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and not before: for God calleth no man to any place, vntill hee haue granted him ſome meanes of diſcharging the duties of that place; and it is one part of an houſholders duty to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for them of his houſhold. The Lord ſends not ſouldiers into the field to fight, without ſome weapons, nor men to houſe-keeping, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome meanes to keepe houſe. Laſtly, when a man, after diligent labour, conuenient watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, due abſtinence, earneſt prayers, and a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſhunning of all times, places, companies, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, that may prouoke ill affections, doth yet ſtill find his heart ſo reſtleſly poſſeſſed with theſe deſires, that he cannot with-hold his will, at leaſt, from often conſenting vnto them; and ſo is diſabled from ſeruing God in duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and his calling, with comfort and cheare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe: to whom God, after all theſe meanes vſed, vouchſafeth not the power of containing, him he cals, to enter into Matrimony. But hee that is ſo tyed in other reſpects, that he cannot marry without wronging another, or wants all fit meanes to maintaine a wife, or in regard of any other let, cannot attaine a wife, ſhall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faile attaine the gift of continency, if hee be carefull to vſe the forenamed meanes, and the like, that God hath appointed to ſubdue luſt. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if men force themſelues to an vnmarried
<pb facs="tcp:8041:5"/>life, either by ſuperſtitious vowes, or incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous feares, or the like, the Lord will likely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh their preſumption or diffidence, by not yeelding his powerfull helpe, and ſo will make them find their owne folly and weakeneſſe. But ſuch is the wiſdome of God to proportion his owne actions to his owne ends, and cauſe, that all his deeds ſhall hold agreement each with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and ſuch is his truth and goodneſſe to them, that faithfully call vpon him that whom himſelfe debarreth from Matrimony, him he will inable to liue chaſtly and purely out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, vpon condition of his vpright and carefull endeuours to get this abilitie. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whoſoeuer is yet a ſeruant to another, or is wholly deſtitute of all meanes, to prouide for a wife and children, or is otherwiſe ſo hindred, that he cannot haue a wife, muſt ſay to himſelfe thus; God hath made me a ſingle man, &amp; would haue me ſo to continue as yet; I will not be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to my ſelfe in ſtriuing for continency, and Gods bleſſing ſhall not be wanting to mine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours, in giuing continency. And hee that is at his owne diſpoſing otherwayes, and enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth conuenient meanes of prouiding for a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhall, for all that, doe beſt to forbeare Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, as I ſuppoſe, if hee perceiue no need of marriage for the preuenting of ſinne, or other important conſideration. For albeit in ſuch caſe the Lord hath left a mans conſcience at libertie (ſo that hee ſinnes not either by abiding in his preſent eſtate, or altering it, which he likes beſt)
<pb facs="tcp:8041:6"/>yet it may ſeeme the wiſeſt way to make choice of that part, which the Scripture rather of the twaine doth ſeeme to commend, ſaying, 1. Cor. 7.1. <hi>It is good for a man not to touch a woman.</hi> 7. <hi>I would that all men were euen as I my ſelfe.</hi> 8. <hi>I ſay to the vnmarried and widdows, it is good for them, if they abide, euen as I,</hi> that is, ſingle. 27. <hi>Art thou looſed from a wife?

The Widdow is <hi>happier, if ſhe abide ſo,</hi> that is vnmarried, <hi>after my iudgement, and I thinke that I alſo haue the Spirit of God.</hi> But yet if God leade any man to marriage, let him follow him, yet ſo, that hee follow him with prudence and diſcretion. Hee whom God ſhall will to fight with an enemy, muſt furniſh himſelfe with fit weapons. <hi>Dauid</hi> gate himſelf a ſling, and ſmooth pibbles out of the valley, when he went to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter <hi>Goliah.</hi> So men muſt arme and furniſh themſelues for marriage, that they may not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour this honourable eſtate, by turning backe from it, in their minds and wiſhes. Specially, he that will bee married, muſt arme himſelfe with patience againſt the troubles of that kind of life, and reſoluing, that hee ſhall meete with them, muſt determine, that hee will behaue himſelfe, not alone quietly, but euen chearefully, though they come apace about him. Digeſt in the ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſideration of thy mind, the cauſe of trouble, ſinne; the vſe of trouble, the healing of ſin; the Sender and Moderator of trouble, God; the end and iſſue of trouble, glorie; that thine
<pb facs="tcp:8041:6"/>heart may neither faint nor fret, becauſe of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; yea, tho ſome heauy and more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie calamitie ſhould betide thee; much leſſe, if thou meete alone with thoſe vſuall matters, which (like ſpirtlings in a dirty way) will ſurely come to the lot of euery man, in euery Family. For to ſee a man ſo fooliſh and abſurd, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made himſelfe the Gouernour of an houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, he can beare no diſorder of wife, children, ſeruants; no diſaſter in goods, cattell, dealings; without chaſing, and fuming, and ſtormes, and without thoſe pangs of a baſe and feeble mind, vaine wiſhes of hauing neuer knowne this wife, or ſo forth, is a ſpectacle of that nature, as may iuſtly mooue diſdaine, as well as pitie in the wiſe beholder. What was he, trow you, a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable man, or a bruit creature, that ruſhed ſo foreſightleſly into marriage, as neuer to ſay to himſelfe, that ſome of theſe things muſt needs befal al that are wedded: And if a man do know, that ſuch things muſt needs happen to all that will marrie, is it not a ſtrange indiſcretion to take on, that they haue happened to himſelfe, who would needs marrie? Make reckoning therefore of croſſes in thy matrimoniall condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then bee carefull to preuent them ſo much as may be. For which end, let mee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend vnto thy conſideration, theſe two things following: When thou art married, if it may be, liue of thy ſelfe with thy wife, in a family of thine owne, and not with another, in one family, as it were, betwixt you both. And in all thy
<pb facs="tcp:8041:7"/>worldly dealings, truſt no more then thou muſt needs; nor otherwiſe, then vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> due ſecurity. The mixing of gouernors in an houſhold, or ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating or vniting of two Maſters, or two Dames vnder one roofe, doth fall out moſt times, to be a matter of much vnquietnes to all parties: Youth and Age are ſo far diſtant in their conſtitutions, that they wil hardly accord in their conditions; and how to make the young folks ſo wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne themſelues vnto the elder, as not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented with their proceedings; or to make the elder ſo much to deny themſelues, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend vnto the wils of the younger; or to make both ſo moderate themſelues, as to meete in the mid-way (without one of which three things, there is no maintaining of concord) is a matter in the beſt natures, &amp; moſt diſcreet perſons, excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding difficult; and in the common ſort of people altogether impoſſible. Wherefore, as the young Bees do ſeek vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues another Hiue; ſo let the young couple another houſe, that they may learne to liue of a little, to know what is their owne, and how it becomes their owne, and to vſe their owne to their owne beſt aduantage, that whatſoeuer come, they may neuer fall into that vnhappieſt of all vnhappineſſes, of either being tormentors of their Parents, or tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them. And for ones worldly affaires, let him truſt as little as is poſſible, and then alſo vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods aſſurance. It is moſt certaine, that the moſt of thoſe with whom a man ſhall deale, will alwayes bee vngodly, and vnrighteous, ſeruing
<pb facs="tcp:8041:7"/>themſelues altogether, and ready to aduantage themſelues by deceite. It were an vncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to ſay before trial, Such a man wil deceiue me, therefore I will not truſt him: but it is wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to thinke before triall, This man may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue me, therefore, if I may, I will forbeare to truſt him; if not, I will truſt him on ſuch termes, as he may not be able, if he ſhould be willing to beguile me. Boldneſſe to borrow, boldneſſe to lend, boldneſſe to truſt, and to be truſted (which likely come from this originall, that men would ouer-faine, either to be rich, or ſeeme ſo,) haue plunged many families into great miſery, which elſe might haue ſailed through the World with a conſtant tenour of proſperitie. Let a man ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bee willing to lay his foundation low, to content himſelfe with the imployment of his owne portion, not delighting to make himſelfe a ſeruant, by making himſelfe a borrower, nor to hazzard himſelfe (more then hee muſt needes) vpon the doubtfull honeſty of ſuch ſlipperie ſeruants, as moſt times borrowers prooue to bee. But forbearing to giue further counſell, I commit the booke following to thy cenſure, praying thee to reade it with iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and fauour, and to be the ſame to the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of another, that thou wouldeſt another ſhould be to thine. So with my beſt wiſhes to God, to make the troubles of thy marriage (if thou beeſt, or ſhalt be married) as eaſie as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible (and the more eaſie, by meanes of that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice which this Treatiſe will giue thee, if thou
<pb facs="tcp:8041:8"/>wilt vouchſafe to reade and conſider it) I leaue thee to the guidance of him, that giueth his gifts to euery man as ſeemeth beſt to himſelfe, and remaine</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Nderſtand, good Reader, that in a former Treatiſe about the duties of the married, intitled, A Bride buſh, I did occaſionally deliuer two poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: One this; The ſinne of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie diſſolueth the bond, and annihilateth the couenant of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie. Another this; The ſinne of wilfull deſertion doth likewiſe diſſolue the bond of Matrimony. Giue me leaue now to aduertiſe thee of ſuch reaſons, as haue been obiected vnto me againſt theſe two poſitions. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the firſt thus: Whatſoeuer man and woman may lawfully conuerſe together in matrimoniall ſocietie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them the bond of matrimony remaineth vndiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued: for vpon this bond, the lawfulneſſe of that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie depends, as vpon the next and immediate cauſe thereof. Now man and wife, euen after the ſinne of adulterie committed by one, or both of them, may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully conuerſe together in matrimoniall ſocietie: For who can thinke, that <hi>Dauid</hi> ſinned, in knowing any other of his wiues, after his offence with <hi>Bathſheba?</hi> Or if any man or woman hauing tranſgreſſed in this kind ſo ſecretly, that none doth know of it, ſhall after forſake the ſinne, and without reuealing it to the yoke-fellow, continue to render due beneuolence; who can ſay, that ſuch ſocietie is vnlawfull? Therefore betwixt
<pb facs="tcp:8041:9"/>man and wife, euen after the ſinne of adulterie, the bond of marriage remaineth vndiſſolued, and therefore the contrary poſition ought not to be holden. Againſt the ſecond thus: He that puts away his wife not for whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and marries another, is guiltie of wilfull deſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (yea, and of adultery too:) For, is it not all one to depart from ones wife, with a mind of neuer returning, and to put away his wife from him, with a mind of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer reaccepting her? Now after ſuch putting away of a mans wife, and marrying another, the bond of matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony remaineth vndiſſolued: for our Sauiour ſaith, That he which marries a woman ſo put away,<note place="margin">Mat. 19.9.</note> commits adultery; which could not be, vnleſſe the bond betwixt her, and her former husband remained vndiſſolued. Therefore at leaſt after ſome deſertion (yea, and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery too) the bond of matrimony remaineth vndiſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; and therfore the contrary poſition muſt be denied. Sweyed by theſe arguments (to which, I confeſſe, that I cannot make a ſatisfying anſwere) I depart from theſe opinions, wiſhing that I had not written them, and that no man, by what I haue written, would imbolden him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, in ſuch caſes, to take at leaſt a doubtfull, and an hazzardfull liberty. So praying God to giue vs a right vnderſtanding in all things, I bid thee farewell.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Apoſtle, in this Chapter, makes anſwere to ſome queſtions, which the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths had by Letter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded vnto him, and that ſpecially concerning matter of marriage: and he giues his directions, firſt, indefinitely, to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:8041:10"/>married; and all ſorts of perſons in the former part of the Chapter; then ſpecially and particularly to Virgins, from the 26. Verſe to the 39. to Widowes in the two laſt Verſes. To Virgins he addreſſeth his counſell in this order, firſt, in a briefe preface, declaring the purport of his words, <hi>viz.</hi> that hee did not giue a preciſe Commandement, as of a thing that bound the conſcience ſtrictly, but alone aduice and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, as of a thing moſt fit and commodious. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he propoundeth his counſell in the 26. Verſe, which comes to this purpoſe; That it is good for a man and woman, in regard of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie and diſtreſſe, to which in this preſent life they are ſubiect, to forbeare marriage, and to continue in Virginitie. Laſtly, he amplifieth and inlargeth this matter, more fully explicating himſelfe, which explication hee begins in the former Verſe and this, interrupts by a pertinent digreſſion in the three following Verſes: and laſtly, goes on in, and finiſheth in the fiue next.</p>
                     <p>Here then the Apoſtle is about to make his meaning ſo manifeſt (in that diſſwaſion from marriage, which formerly he had vſed) that no occaſion of hurt might grow from the miſtaking thereof. And as in the former Verſe he had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed men, neither to be wearie of marriage, if they were married; nor yet to bee couetous of it, if they were looſe; ſo here he ſhewes, in what reſpects he diſcounſelleth it, <hi>viz.</hi> (firſt, negatiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) not as a ſinne (nay, he plainely confeſſeth the lawfulneſſe of it, ſaying, If thou (being a man)
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8041:10"/>ſhalt marry, thou ſinneſt not; and if a Virgin marry, ſhe ſinneth not) but (ſecondly, affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely) as a matter of more outward and bodily trouble; for ſuch, ſaith he, ſhall haue trouble in the fleſh: but, ſaith he, I ſpare you; that is, I will not vſe more earneſtneſſe to diſſwade you from that, that moſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are vnwilling to be diſſwaded from. To ſpare, is not to preſſe them ouer-hard to that, whereto they would not bee drawne, without ſome backwardneſſe. The thing then that the Apoſtle deliuers in this verſe, is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this, That marriage is not to be forborne, as a matter ſinfull, but troubleſome, and virginitie to be imbraced, not as a ſtate of life more holy, but alone more eaſefull; and that he diſſwadeth marriage, not as if it were in any ſort to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted vnlawfull to marrie, but alone, becauſe it is commonly attended vpon with more difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties then ſingle life; in which regard alſo he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beareth to vrge the forbearance of it any thing earneſtly.

                        <hi>viz.</hi> that that was ſpoken to <hi>Peter</hi> in his trance, <hi>That that God hath cleanſed, cal not thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> The Lord had remoued the diſtinction of meates (in regard of conſcience to him-ward) which was of force vnder the Leuiticall Law. That <hi>Peter</hi> might be informed of this needfull truth, whereof he was yet ignorant, he is bidden (in a Viſion wherein all manner of beaſts were offered to him being hungry) <hi>to kill and eate:</hi> hee refuſeth, becauſe the things were ſuch as the Law condemned for vncleane and common. The voyce tels him the ſecond time, that it was not for him to make that common, which God had made cleane. Loe how the cleanneſſe or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe of things is not to bee ordered by mans authoritie, no, not by the authoritie of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> himſelfe, ſo that a man would wonder how hee that calleth himſelfe the ſucceſſor of <hi>Peter,</hi>

If a ſeruant put gyues or irons vpon his owne legs, he cannot goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward nimbly in his Maſters buſineſſe: So if a Chriſtian doe ſhackle his owne conſcience, hee cannot with chearefulneſſe performe the wil of God in holineſſe of liuing: For to him that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts a thing ſinfull, to him it is ſinne, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle faith, Rom. 14.14.

Thus doth a man caſt himſelfe ineuitably vpon a neceſſitie of ſinning, and ſo vpon vnquietneſſe, perplexitie, and much inauoydable miſerie, to the great trouble, not of himſelfe alone, but of others alſo, with whom he liueth, to whom his intangled conſcience will not ſuffer him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his duty with loue and readineſſe, as hee ought to doe.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, by ſo miſ-taking, a man is made apt (which is a neceſſarie conſequent of pride) to cenſure other men, to thinke hardly of them, to condemne them, as perſons vtterly reckleſſe and vnconſcionable, as if they regarded not at all what they did, becauſe it ſtands not with their minds, to runne in ſo narrow a line, as himſelfe runneth in. Thus in <hi>Pauls</hi> time, the men that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:8041:12"/>would not eate, were alwaies forward to iudge and condemne thoſe that would eate. For when a man, out of an erring conſcience, forbeareth thoſe things, in which another vſeth his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, he muſt either condemne himſelfe, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or elſe leaue another wholly to God: ſelf-loue will not ſuffer men to blame themſelues, ſelfe-conceitedneſſe will not ſuffer them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the matter wholly to God: wherefore of neceſſitie (in the moſt part of men) iudging, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning, cenſuring, and hard conceites muſt follow thereupon.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Laſt of all, this making of new ſinnes doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer moſt palpable violence to Chriſtian libertie, and is as direct an impeachment of that inward ſpirituall freedome, which Chriſt hath procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the conſciences of his people, as any can be in the world. Theſe erroneous opinions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrall the conſcience, and bring it in ſlauerie; they tye it, where God tyes it not; they doe as it were, hedge and ditch in a part of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which God would haue lye open, and ſuffer not the conſcience to enioy ſo large a walk as God hath allowed: they doe, in a ſort, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pale, or imparke the ſoule, and after a ſort, cub it vp, that it cannot in many caſes enioy that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, peace, and comfort, nor performe that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, homage and duty, which it ought to enioy or performe. So hath Chriſt wrong, in that his ſeruants are not permitted to partake of the freedome that he hath allotted them; and God is wronged alſo, in that error takes vpon it to be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:8041:13"/>wiſer and iuſter then hee; and darkeneſſe will make it ſelfe beleeue, that it hath diſcouered more, then light it ſelfe did diſcouer; and a blind perſon will beare himſelfe bold, in the place of a guide and leader in the way. All theſe miſchiefes inſue, vpon the reputing of ſinleſſe things ſinfull, and therefore it is not without iuſt reaſon, that our Apoſtle is ſo plaine and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe in this matter; <hi>He ſinneth not: She ſinneth not.</hi>

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, there are two extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties much to bee ſhunned, and happie (moſt happie) were wee all, if the Lord would vouchſafe to aſſiſt vs with ſo much light and grace, that all of vs might be able to ſhun both twaine of them. The one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme is (out of a vaſt, wide, retching, and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding conſcience) to deeme any thing lawfull, vnleſſe it be as palpable (as the Prouerbe hath it) as the noſe in a mans face, and as manifeſt, as the Sunne ſhining in his brightneſſe. This looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, this licentiouſneſſe, this ſtriuing to make all things ſeeme lawfull, that any way pleaſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and may bring with them, eaſe, pleaſure, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity, is the much more dangerous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:8041:13"/>cauſing ſome men to defend, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe they care not what, worſhipping of Images, common ſwearing, the vſe of Inchantments, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling and profane ſporting on the Lords day, and diuers more abominations againſt euery Commandement. But there is alſo another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie, which clogs a man with ſcrupulouſnes, ſo as he ſtarts back almoſt from euery thing, as if it were a ſinne, and becomes ſo timorous and doubting, that hee dares ſcarce aduenture vpon any action, if it be not on the other ſide as cleare, as the Sunne in his Noone-height. The one of thoſe is like a careleſſe man, that beleeues euery man who ſpeakes him faire, though bee a very coozener; the other is like a ſuſpicious and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtfull man, that will beleeue no man, be he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo plaine and vpright. Though this latter be the leſſe diſpraiſeable extreme, yet without doubt it is a great fault, the breeder of many wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full euils, being commonly the teſtimony of an vnſtayed, and inſufficient iudgement, ouer-ruled by preiudice and by paſſion. Therefore you are as well to bee dehorted from the one of theſe euils, as the other; which though you haue not, perhaps, ſo well conſidered of heretofore, yet now let the Apoſtles words make you take dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent heede vnto it. It is an offence againſt God, a wrong to thy ſelfe, an hindrance to thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſeruiceableneſſe, a gawling to thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and a procurer of much vnhappines: to conceiue falſly within thy ſelf of any thing, This is not lawfull; If I do this, I ſhall ſin againſt God,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:8041:14"/>when indeed thou ſhalt not ſinne; as to conceine falſely, This is lawfull for me; This I may do, when indeed thou mayeſt not do it. Know now, that both theſe are by-paths, both are out-ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and that in the wilderneſſe of this World, thou mayeſt as quickly, and wel-neere as dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly wander in the one of theſe wayes, as the other; and therfore be thou as carefull and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, not to ſtep awry in the one, as in the other path. I preſſe this the rather, becauſe I haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in experience, that many men become ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reclaimeable, in regard of this ſcrupulouſneſſe, out of a conceite they haue, that there is little or no danger in it. But they are deceiued; A man may hurt himſelfe, offend his brethren, diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God, trouble the world, and caſt himſelfe to hell, by ſtrayning at Gnats, as well as by ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Camels. To doe a thing, in many caſes is no ſinne, neither is it a ſinne to forbeare; but to condemne a thing not worthy to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to ſtretch ones wits, to make a lawfull thing ſeeme wicked, and to be ſtiffe in ſuch a forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, this is alwaies naught, and alwaies dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. What miſchief hath come into the world, by making marriage a ſin to ſome men, to whom it was no ſinne? How hath the world bin peſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with troubles and contentions about things of no moment, becauſe ſome men would not, or could not ſee, that lawfull things were lawfull? In a word, I know not whether the Church of God doe not as much ſmart and bleed, by the wounds that ſcrupulouſneſſe giues her, as by
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:8041:14"/>thoſe which vnconſcionableneſſe giues her. Oh that once ſhe might bee cured of both at once!</p>
                     <p>And that you may the better preſerue your ſelues from ſuch miſtaking,<note place="margin">Directions to keepe our ſelues from making no ſinnes, ſinnes: firſt, generall.</note> I will deliuer ſome few directions; firſt generall; then ſpeciall. In generall obſerue theſe fiue Rules:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, in iudging of points controuerted, let a man place his mind in a flat indifferencie, and make it meerely neutrall; for if a man ſhall bend his wil and affections one way, deſiring for ſome reſpect, to haue this part rather true, then that in a matter queſtioned; this deſire will carry him away, as the bias doth the bowle, many times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth. Vnequall ballances will doe wrong in weighing, though the weights bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, when the mind is brought to this perfect neutralitie, paſſe not ſentence haſtily, but vpon ſerious deliberation, taking aduice (if by any meanes occaſion ſerue) whether by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference, as wel, as much, as often, with thoſe that hold on the one ſide, as on the other. He that ſpeaketh firſt, is commonly righteous, but his neighbour commeth after, and findeth him out: He ſhall neuer be an indifferent Iudge betwixt party and party, that is loth to heare the allegations of the one ſide, and willing to heare all that can be alleaged on the other; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall he euer diſcerne aright betwixt opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and opinion, that is glad to bee acquainted with any reaſons that may make for the one opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but if diſcontented (at leaſt not very well
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:8041:15"/>pleaſed) if hee heare that contradicted, and the contrary maintained.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Hearken to all ſuch diſtinctions and limitations, as haue ground and warrant out of Scripture: for as the cauſe of licentiouſneſſe is, for the moſt part, a boldneſſe to frame diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or limitations, without ground from the written Word; ſo ſcrupulouſneſſe doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ariſe from hence, that men either heed not, or will not yeeld vnto thoſe diſtinctions and limitations, which God himſelfe hath led vs vnto in his Word.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, let nothing be counted a ſin, which Scripture doth not condemne as a ſinne, and what the Word (the rule of truth and falſehood) doth not ſhew vs to be vnlawfull, that let vs hold to be lawfull. Safely may one conclude in all manner of actions, I will take that as warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, againſt which I find nothing written. Yea verily, it is more then a probable reaſon, the Word of God hath left a thing in ſuch doubtful ſort, that many godly, vertuous, and learned men doe thinke it lawfull, and therefore I will incline rather to thinke it lawfull, then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: for hardly would it ſtand with Gods goodnes, to leaue ſinnes ſo doubtfully diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as that wiſe and godly men, when the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter commeth to diſcuſſing, ſhould not be able to ſee the ſinfulneſſe thereof.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, beware of ſuffering preiudice, exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, humour, to ſway you, in iudging the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or vnlawfulneſſe of things. Bee ready in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:8041:15"/>matters controuerted, to change opinions, to thinke otherwiſe then thou haſt thought, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then thou haſt been long knowne to think, otherwiſe then men of great eſteeme with thy ſelfe haue thought; and beware that choller and melancholy doe not dazle thine eyes; and to that end, if thou beeſt inclined to either of theſe humours, bee afraid of them, and yeeld leſſe to thine authoritie becauſe of them: for ſtiffeneſſe in opinions (a fruit commonly of the three fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named things) is nothing praiſe-worthy. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in expreſſe truths is a notable vertue; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorineſſe in matters not plainely reuealed, is a vice, and not a vertue.</p>
                     <p>And theſe be fiue generall Rules, which will conduce much to the true freedome of the iudgement. I will adde as many more ſpeciall Rules, which are theſe.</p>
                     <p>Firt,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>2.</hi> Speciall.</note> example of good men in Scripture doe not bind conſcience, but onely (ſuppoſing them not contradictorie to precepts) warrant it; they doe not make a thing needfull, or ſinfull, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone declare it indifferent and lawfull: ſo, what I can ſhew ſome godly man in Scripture to haue done before me (no precept being for, or againſt it) that (not I muſt doe, or elſe I ſinne, but) I may doe without ſinne. <hi>Abraham</hi> made a great feaſt at the weaning of <hi>Iſaac;</hi> yet is no father bound ſo to doe, though any wealthy father may doe ſo, if he pleaſe. Our Sauiour being inuited to a Wedding feaſt, did goe to it; yet is no man tyed to doe ſo, but alone allowed. When our Sauiour
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:8041:16"/>preached ſolemnely in the Synagogue at Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, it is noted, that he ſtood vp to reade, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the booke, read the portion of Scripture out of the booke which he minded to ſpeake of, then ſhut the booke againe, and ſate downe, and ſpake vnto them: yet to theſe particularities is no mans conſcience bound in preaching, but hee may, if he will, ſit in reading his Text, or if hee will, he may ſay it without booke, and not reade it, and may ſtand vp and interpret, and apply it. So in many other particulars. In this caſe the Scriptures are cleare;<note place="margin">Rom. 3.20, 4.15.</note> 
                        <hi>By the Law commeth the knowledge of ſinne.</hi> And againe: <hi>Where there is no Law, there is no ſinne.</hi> Now the Law is a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of ſome perſon, that hath power to command, and not an action of any man vnder authority. This rule is of admirable vſe, in iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things: for many a man doth clog vp his conſcience, by binding himſelfe to meere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.56.</note> whereas the ſtrength of ſinne is the Law.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, humane inuentions are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnlawfull in the formes, order, circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſolemnitie of Diuine Seruice or worſhip, becauſe they are meere humane inuentions, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in ſome other reſpect, ſome ſinfulneſſe bee found in them, no, nor though ſome kind of ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification bee aimed at in them. For example, In ſome Churches I haue ſeene a Flowre ſet vp by the houre-glaſſe on the Pulpit, to expreſſe this conceite, that the preaching of the Word is euen the Flowre of the place, yet cannot thinke
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:8041:16"/>any man ſo ſcrupulous, as to thinke it vnlawfull. In other Churches, hath a Lanthorne been fairely ingrauen ouer the Pulpit, with this word aboue, <hi>Thy Word is a Lanthorne to my feete;</hi> yet I hope no ſinne committed. In moſt Churches of great Townes, you ſhall ſee the Bible held vp with an Eagle; (no queſtion, at the firſt this was done, to expreſſe ſome conceite of Gods carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Word vpon Eagles wings) yet I neuer heard man that found fault with that Image in the ſeruice of God. So in ſwearing, wee vſe to lay our hands vpon the Bible, and to kiſſe the Bible, in token of that reuerence we owe to him, by whom we ſweare according to the contents of that Booke; yet no man that I know, hath picked a quarrell with this vſage, although an oath be well knowne to be a worthy ſeruice of God, if it be duly performed. So you may note a ſolemnitie in ſwearing, vſed by <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> of putting the hand vnder the thigh. So there was a ſolemnitie accuſtomed in reading the Law, Nehem. 8.5, 6. which the Law it ſelfe did neuer preſcribe. For when the Prieſt ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the booke, all the people ſtood vp, then did <hi>Ezra</hi> bleſſe God with a loud voyce, then did the people bow downe their heads and worſhip: ſurely ſuch ſtanding vp, ſuch bleſſing, ſuch bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe is no where commanded in the bookes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> neither any where elſe, yet no man will ſay, they were ſinfull. So had the Iewes Synagogues in their Cities, and portions to be read out of the Law and Prophets, ſome
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:8041:17"/>on ſuch a day, ſome on ſuch a day; yet for theſe the Law taketh none order at all, neither for all that did the Iewes ſinne in hauing Synagogues, and the Word in ſuch order read in them. So in the manner of celebrating the Paſſeouer, the Iewes had diuers orders, by name theſe; firſt, that they ſhould neither ſtand, nor ſit vpright, but lie along vpon beds, to ſignifie their preſent ſecuritie, that eate it at leaſure, not in haſte, as at the firſt; ſecondly, that the Maſter of the feaſt in the end of the Supper, ſhould take a loafe and break it, and bleſſe, &amp; them diſtribute to all thoſe that were preſent, and alſo ſhould take Wine, and bleſſe, and diſtribute to al that were preſent; thirdly, to waſh their feet in that ſupper; fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to ſing an Hymne (with ſome others.) Now our Sauiour Chriſt did vſe all theſe rites, and from one of them, tooke occaſion to inſtitute his laſt Supper our holy Sacrament; and yet none of all theſe is preſcribed or mentioned in the Law, but rather the ſeeming contrary, an eating in haſte with ſtaues in their hands. So Neh. 5.13. when that holy man pronounced the curſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt exactors (in the making of a ſolemne co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant that they ſhould ceaſe their extortion) he ſhooke his lap, and ſaid; <hi>So let God ſhake him that doth not performe this couenant, out of his houſe and labour.</hi> No manner of precept for this ſigne and ſolemnitie in pronouncing a curſe: yet doubtles it was lawfull. So Nehem. 11.27. Hee ordained a ſolemne dedication of the wall of Ieruſalem, and performed it with ſolemne Proceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of two
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:8041:17"/>troopes of the holy Muſicians with their Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, going one troope one way, the other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and meeting both in the Temple. Surely no ſuch thing was appointed in the Law, yet no man blamed this as a ſinne. So <hi>Dauid</hi> in remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Arke, vſed diuers ſolemnities: for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe followed, clothed in a linnen Ephod, all the Muſician attended alſo, clothed in linnen E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phods; and when the Liuites that bare the Arke, had gone ſixe paces, he offered Oxen and Fatlings, euen ſeuen Bullocks, and ſeuen Lambs, as appeareth, comparing 2. Sam. 13. with 1. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth. 15.27. the Law required no ſuch number, or order of offering, no ſuch garments, either for him or them. It is manifeſt then, that if hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inuentions of theſe kinds, bee not made parts of worſhip by any falſe doctrine, or falſe opinion about them, and neither bee ſuch as for multitude, or other conſideration, doe darken and obſcure the ſeruice of God, rather then adde any ſolemnity or celebritie to it, they are not to be accounted vnlawfull.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, things in themſelues lawfull, but abuſed to ſuperſtition or Idolatry, are not by the ſuch abuſe of them, made vnlawfull to bee vſed (of thoſe that know the truth, and are free from ſuch abuſiue conceite of them) either in ciuill life, or in the ſolemnities of Diuine Seruice. For example: Churches built and dedicate to Idols, may lawfully be conuerted to the ſeruice of the true God, and there is no neceſſitie of pulling them down, and building other in their roomes.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:8041:18"/>Lying along on beds, and feaſting in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, was greatly abuſed of the Romanes in their publike Idolatrie, called <hi>Lectiſternia,</hi> yet the Iewes did keepe that geſture in their Paſſeouer, and our Sauiour co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formed thereto, yea, though then, many of the Romanes liued among them, and they were vnder the gouernement of the Romanes. Meate offered to Idols, might be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at any feaſt (ſaue in the Idols Temple) yea, at their Loue-feaſts, which were accuſtomed to be made, when they met to receiue the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: for now to the pure,<note place="margin">Tit. 1.15.</note> all things are pure, and now it is lawful to become all things to all men, yea, to him that is without Law,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.21, 22</note> to bee made as without Law; which could not bee, if his abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of a lawfull thing to ſuperſtition, made it vnlawfull for me to conforme with him in that thing. For indeed, the ſtrict and preciſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, whereby God did inioyne the Iewes to ſhun the cuſtomes of the Gentiles, euen in things otherwiſe lawfull, becauſe by them abuſed, was proper to the times of the Law, as being part of that partition wall which Chriſt hath broken downe, that hee might make of both one.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, ſcandals, offences, inconuenient ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and conſequents, doe not proue any thing to be vnlawfull, but alone inexpedient, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conclude, that ſuch and ſuch a thing may not lawfully be done, but alone; may not in ſuch a place, at ſuch a time, before ſuch a perſon, bee conueniently done: and ſo not the thing is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:8041:18"/>but the doer ſinneth in doing a lawfull thing vnexpediently. Eating meate offered to Idols, would ſcandalize ſome weake ones, yet the Apoſtle neuer condemnes it as a ſin to eate meate offered to Idols (yea, he allowes to eate whatſoeuer is ſet before a man,) but he ſaith, <hi>To him that eateth with offence, to him it is ſinne.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 14.20.</note> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſideration of ſuch ſcandals cannot beare a man out, in not doing what the Magiſtrate commandeth. Scandall ſhould cauſe me to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare alone, in things left to mine owne wil and choyce; but in things commanded by a Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, I muſt not ſo farre heede ſcandals, as not to ſubmit my ſelfe; for this (at leaſt appearance of) diſobedience, is worſe then any ſcandall. A ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall is properly the abuſe of Chriſtian libertie, through vndiſcreete and vncharitable doing of a thing, in it ſelfe lawfull, without regard of my neighbours hurt that may come thence. Now, when I am commanded by authoritie of Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, to doe a thing lawfull, then doe I not, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vndiſcreetly, or vncharitably, vſe my liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but according to the bond of conſcience laid vpon me by God: wherefore to be offended at my ſo doing, is an vndiſcreete and vncharitable part of him that is offended.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, things that haue a generall allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance by Gods Word, without reſtraint or limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, may lawfully and warrantably bee appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by mens appointment to any particular time, place and action, that they ſhall ſee fit ſo to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them. For example: To ſing a Pſalme, is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:8041:19"/>ſufficiently warranted in Scripture: therefore it is lawfull to ordaine, that a Pſalme ſhall be vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſung before or after Sermon: neither can any man find fault with ſuch order, as if it were will-worſhip. So to pray, is warrantable by the Word; therefore to make an order, that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhal make a praier before or after their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, or both, is not ſinfull, nor cannot bee bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as a matter of voluntarie Religion, though in all the writings of the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, we neuer reade, to my remembrance, that either Chriſt himſelfe, or any Prophet or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle did ſo. So to adore Chriſt, by bowing of the knee vnto him, is lawfull, and hath generall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant out of the Word of God, as all yeeld (for to me ſhall euery knee bow, is a thing that God hath ſworne;) therefore it cannot but follow, that to bow the knee to him, in the act of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Sacrament, is alſo lawfull; for generals not limited by God, doe giue our conſciences warrant to their vttermoſt generalitie, ſo farre as they may not daſh againſt ſome other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</p>
                     <p>Theſe directions (Brethren) I am bold to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound vnto you, as vndoubted truths, ſo farre as my iudgement reacheth; and, O that God would pleaſe to ſettle you in your iuſt freedome of conſcience! the enioying whereof, would be no leſſe comfortable &amp; profitable vnto your ſoules, then the walking at large, without hauing chaines vpon your legs, is delightfull and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall to your bodies. And (Lord) now guide all
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:8041:19"/>our minds in ſuch ſort, by thy good Spirit, that we may know what chearefull liberty thou doſt vouchſafe vs, and may not ſinne againſt thy ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigntie, by falſe-impriſoning our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, without thy warrant.</p>

Marriage is a lawfull ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for all ſorts: no vnmarried man ſhall ſinne by marrying; no maide ſhall ſin in taking a husband. Any batchelour may make himſelfe a husband; any virgin may make her ſelfe a wife: and for the act it ſelfe, no ſinne ſhall be imputed vnto them, though for the manner of doing, and ſuch common circumſtances, as cloath all actions, they may behaue themſelues ſinfully.

And ſeeing there is no ſort of men which can be aſſured (otherwiſe then by this helpe) to be freed from thoſe deſires, more then their neighbours; it muſt needs follow, that God would haue it common to all ſorts, and equally lawfull for all. <hi>Adam</hi> in his beſt eſtate (when he ſtood as a common father to all mankind) did marrie, and by Gods owne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment did marrie; and therefore it muſt needs be lawfull for any of this poſterity to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>

To the vnmarried wee haue a double inſtruction: the firſt is this; that he preferre not a ſinfull ſingle life, before a finleſſe marriage, as ſome haue (fooliſhly and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily) done, either our of a couetous mind, or of a licentious mind, or both. Many a man looking with an ouer-carnall eye, vpon the troubles that attend matrimony, &amp; conſidering the many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities which doe commonly tread vpon the heeles of this eſtate (wherof alſo we ſhal ſpeak at large anon) do chuſe rather to poiſon their ſoules with the deadly poyſon of whoredome, then to be a little incumbred in this preſent life. But I pray you my brethren, be not ſo ouer-warie for your carnall eaſe: Take not leaue to your ſelues to liue in frequent pollutions and impurities, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then in honeſt matrimonie, for ſcare for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, of thoſe diuers inconueniences, with which marriage, becauſe of ſinne, is vſually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied. Marriage is no ſinne, whoredome
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:8041:21"/>is. He that takes a wife, offends not God, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangers not himſelfe to hardneſſe of heart, and eternall damnation: but he which takes an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, or defileth himſelfe with other pollutions, both prouokes Gods wrath againſt himſelfe, and alſo caſts himſelfe into the very pit of hell, ſo much as in him lyeth. Wherefore if any mans neceſſity be ſuch, that he cannot reſtraine his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, nor keepe his wiſhes within compaſſe, but that in ſpight of all his earneſt endeauours to the contrary, they worke and boyle within him, let him pray vnto God, to make conuenient prouiſion for him, and imbrace marriage with ſome miſerie, rather then ſweete ſinne, that is to ſay, deadly poyſon, becauſe it pleaſeth in the taſte. None inconueniences, none incumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are anſwerable to the grieuouſneſſe of ſinne. It is Gods wonderfull goodneſſe, that (knowing the temper and diſpoſition of men in this kind) hee hath debarred no man from this ordinance, but hath allowed them a remedie againſt ſinne, which it ſelfe is no ſinne. Remember the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſaying in this place, <hi>He that marries, ſinneth not;</hi> and compare it with other diſorders, which men fal into for want of marriage. He that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits fornication, ſinneth; he that commits adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, ſinneth; hee that defileth himſelfe with other more vnnaturall commixtures, ſinneth; yea, he that burneth (that is to ſay, liues in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall ſtrong and maſterfull deſires, preuailing againſt all his reſolutions, and carrying away his will, though not his body, he alſo) ſinneth: but
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:8041:22"/>he that marrieth, doth not ſinne, Therefore it is better to marry, then commit fornication; it is better to marry, then to commit adultery; it is better to marrie, then to commit vncleaneſſe; it is better to marrie, then to burne; it is better to aduenture vpon trouble without ſinne, then vpon ſinne without trouble. I ſpeake not this, to make any man leſſe carefll, in ſtriuing againſt his owne deſires, and in vſing all vertuous and holy meanes of beating downe his luſts, neither would abate any whit of a mans earneſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, to liue chaſtly in ſingle life, and ſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſingle: but I ſpeake it, to ſhew, that if any man find his paſſions too ſtrong for him, and perceiue that he cannot, but either marry or ſin, he ſhould rather marry without ſinne, then ſinne without marriage. It is no wiſe courſe to ruſh vpon hell hereafter, to auoyde trouble for the preſent. But, if the feare of trouble, ſhould not make a man forbeare matrimony (that cannot otherwiſe continue chaſte,) how much leſſe ſhould the vnwillingneſſe to be confined to one perſon, make a man continue vnyoked, that he might more freely giue ouer himſelfe to his wandring and vnſatiable appetite? This were a notable cntempt of Gods ordinance, and a ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of ones ſelfe ouer to worke vncleanneſſe with greedineſſe. He that of purpoſe forbeares the medicine, becauſe hee would not haue his diſeaſe cured, muſt needes periſh by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, when God alloweth all men to marrie, that cannot containe; he that refuſeth marriage,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:8041:22"/>becauſe he would nor containe, doth yeeld him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo farre at length, to the power of inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie, that euen marriage it ſelfe will bee vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to repreſſe his vnruly deſires; and thus he brings vpon himſelfe extreme hard-hearred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, euen ſo, that hee is without feeling, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, and by ſelling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vp to ſinne, cauſeth God in inſtice to giue him wholly ouer to the luſts of his owne heart, and to the effectuall working of Satans temptations, till at the end, his luſt be beyond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, becauſe at firſt hee refuſed the remedie, for the loue of luſt. O let none amongſt you be ſo wicked, as to forbeare to liue a married per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the nonc't, that he may liue a beaſt. But whoſoeuer he or ſhe be, that is not of power to containe, let him acknowledge and enioy the goodneſſe of God, and preuent ſinne, by that which is no ſinne, euen by marrying.</p>

When <hi>Paul</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:8041:23"/>
                        <hi>If thou marrieſt, thou ſinneſt not:</hi> He mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth this, of marriage it ſelfe; in it ſelfe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, nor alſo of the manner and other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of marriage: for in theſe, whoſoeuer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders themſelues, doth ſin grieuouſly, though marriage it ſelfe be not ſinne. Let vs therefore propound ſome neceſſarie directions, which if the vnmarried obſerue, in the making of their marriage, they may bee ſure to doe this lawfull worke lawfully. And, forbearing to mention thoſe, which are common to al actions (<hi>viz.</hi> that the doer be in Chriſt, doe them in faith, ayme at the right end, and ſuch like) let vs name alone thoſe that doe particularly concerne this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent matter.<note place="margin">Two things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, that a man may marrie lawfully: firſt, in the perſons to be married: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, ſufficient diſtance of blood.</note> Whoſoeuer then is yet vnmarried, and would be ſure to marrie lawfully, muſt haue ſpeciall care of two things: Firſt, that he marry with a fit perſon: Secondly, that if he haue pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, he take their conſent with him. Now, in the perſons to be thus ioyned, three properties are requiſite; the firſt two being ſo abſolutely needfull, that without them, marriage is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, but alone in name: the third, in ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree needfull, that it cannot be neglected, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great ſinne againſt God. Of theſe three, the firſt is, ſufficient diſtance in bloud and affinitie; the ſecond entire freedome from all other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; the laſt, agreement in the ſame true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For the firſt of theſe, the Lord hath expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prohibited men and women, to come neere any the kindred of their fleſh. Whoſoeuer ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preſumeth to be ioyned to any ſuch, doth
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:8041:23"/>nothing elſe, but cloake the foule ſin of Inceſt, with the faire title of Matrimony. And becauſe affinitie is a ſhadow and reſemblance of kindred (for by marriage, two become one fleſh) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo, ſome are debarred marriage together, in that reſpect. Now this matter of conſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and affinitie will be cleared, by the due ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of theſe briefe and plaine rules fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.<note place="margin">Rules for the clearing of the queſtions about affinitie and conſanguinitie.</note> Firſt, <hi>No man or woman may lawfully mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie any of thoſe, that touch them in a direct line vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or downeward, to all generations.</hi> As <hi>Adam,</hi> if he were aliue, and a Widdower, might not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully marry any woman in all the world, neither might <hi>Euah,</hi> if the were aliue and a widdow, bee lawfully married to any man. The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in all theſe, the ſame blood doth run along ſtill vndeuided, and ſo they are properly the kindred of their fleſh. Secondly, <hi>No man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may lawfully marrie the brother, or ſiſter of any his ſucceſſors, or predeceſſors in a direct line, to all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</hi> So <hi>Abel,</hi> being <hi>Seths</hi> brother (of whom all the women in the world are directly procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) might not, if he were aliue, marry any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the world. So the brother of a womans father or grandfather, or great grandfather, may not lawfully marry that woman. The roaſon of this is alſo plaine: for the brother and ſiſter of ones father or mother, is to him or her in place of a father and mother. And in theſe alſo the ſame blood remaineth vndeuided; for brothers and ſiſters are one and the ſame blood. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>No man or woman may lawfully marrie his or her
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:8041:24"/>naturall brother, or ſiſter, either by the whole, or by the halfe blood.</hi> As neither <hi>Ruben</hi> that had the ſame father and mother, nor <hi>Ioſeph</hi> that had alone the ſame father, might lawfully marrie <hi>Dinah</hi> their ſiſter.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>What man is ſo neere in blood to the husband, that he might not lawfully marry him, if the ſex did ſerue; him neither may the wife marry after her husbands death;</hi> and ſo contrarily. So I might not marrie mine vncle (if I were a woman;) therfore if I were dead, my wife might not lawfully bee married to mine vncle: ſo my wife, if ſhe were a man, might not lawfully marrie her ſiſter; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if my wife were dead, I might not lawfully marrie her ſiſter, of which the reaſon is plaine, husband and wife are one fleſh, and therefore with what perſons kindred would not ſuffer one of them to marrie, neither will affinitie ſuffer the other. But whatſoeuer perſons are not by theſe foure rules debarred from matrimony each with other, they may lawfully marry toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without ſcruple, ſo farre as I can diſcerne. Onely for this matter, I referre euery man, to the table of degrees authorized by our Church, and publikely ſet vp in euerie of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. And ſo much of the firſt thing required in the perſons that ſhall bee linked in wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is likewiſe to be ſpoken of,<note place="margin">Secondly free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from all other perſons.</note> and it is the freedom of both parties fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any other: for if any man take a woman, who is either eſpouſed, or wedded to another man, is it not plaine, that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:8041:24"/>he takes his neighbours wife? and therefore in ſhew, liues in marriage, but indeed liues in adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie. The Lord would haue men and women enter into matrimonie, as it were leaſurely and with deliberation: and for this cauſe it is his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, that the couenant ſhould bee perfected betwixt them in two degrees; the one is Eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, or betrothment, which they call, Making ſure, and is nothing elſe but a giuing the right of each others bodies, by a ſolemne and ſerious promiſe of marriage hereafter to be conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: the other is Wedding, called alſo by the name of Marriage, and is nothing but a giuing of the poſſeſſion of each others bodies, by a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne and ſerious promiſe to liue together du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring life.</p>
                     <p>Now the Scripture, in the two and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth Chapter of Deuteronomie,<note place="margin">Deut. 22.22, 23, 24.</note> doth as well call the betrothed woman, a wife of him that betrothed her, as the wedded woman, of him that wedded her; and doth appoint a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trothed maide to die for violating her eſpouſals, by lying with another man afterwards, as well as the wedded wife, for violating wedlocke: ſo it is manifeſt, that if any man or woman haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trothed him, or her ſelfe to any one perſon, it is become now vtterly vnlawful for them, to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie with any other perſon, vnleſſe the contract be lawfully diſſolued (by the falling out, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealing of ſome thing after the contract, which may diſanull it:) as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſuppoſing <hi>Marie</hi> to haue been with child by ſome other (before his
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:8041:25"/>eſpouſing her) now that he found her to be big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellyed, reſolued to put her away. And it is much more manifeſt, that he or ſhe which haue been married to another perſon, are bound by the Law, ſo long as ſuch perſon liueth: ſo that if they marrie any other, they ſhal commit adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as the Apoſtle tels vs in expreſſe termes. But thirdly,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rom. 17.2.3.</hi> Identitie of Religion.</note> no man or woman of the true Religion, may lawfully marrie together, with thoſe of a falſe;<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. laſt.</note> as Chriſtians with Turkes or Pagans: as <hi>Paul</hi> alſo telleth the woman, whoſe husband is dead, that ſhe is at libertie to marrie whom ſhee will, but onely in the Lord; and ſhe marries not in the Lord, if ſhe marrie one that is not of the true Religion of our Lord.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 6.14.</note> Yea, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth abſolutely forbid the being vnequally yoked with Infidels, asking, What communion the Temple of God can haue with Idols? Which prohibition, if it bee not to be vnderſtood onely of being yoked with them in matrimonie, yet at leaſt, as a generall, muſt include that particular, and principally that, as being the principall yo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king together that is. It is not good plowing with an Oxe and an Aſſe, as alſo the Law did ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pically forewarne. And theſe things are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, in regard of the perſons contracting matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie.</p>
                     <p>It is further neceſſarie,<note place="margin">Secondly, that if they haue Pa rems, they haue Parents conſent.</note> that ſuch ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as haue Parents, and are vnder their tution, be matched together by their conſent. A ſonne or daughter honour not their Parents, if they preſume to match themſelues, without the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:8041:25"/>or good liking of their Parents, vnleſſe their Parents forfeie this part of their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, by abuſing it, in not ſuffering them to marrie in the Lord, but offering to force them marrie againſt the will of God, or elſe to abide vnmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. No gift of any thing is good, vnleſſe all thoſe perſons that are intereſſed into the thing giuen, doe giue their conſent, as reaſon doth euince: for no man can paſſe away anothers right, without his liking. Now, the father hath intereſt into his child, as into his goods: for God allowed, that the children alſo ſhould bee ſold to pay his debts; which had been a moſt vniuſt thing, if the Parents had not had as much intereſt into them, as to any other part of their ſubſtance. Therefore marriage being a contract of giuing and receiuing, the childs giuing of himſelfe, mee thinks, ſhould be of ſmall force, without the Parents good will, who haue ſo chiefe a right into him. Surely thoſe whom God hath not ioyned, are not lawfully ioyned. Now God ioyneth men alone two wayes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mediately, or immediately. Immediately hee ioyneth not any in our times, therefore if they be not by him ioyned mediately, they bee either vnioyned, or ill ioyned. Now, vnleſſe their Parents giue conſent, they cannot bee ſaid to bee ioyned by God mediately: for why, when God hath put any perſon, as it were, in his roome, as his aſſignes to doelany thing, it is not done by him, vnleſſe that perſon doe it, whom he hath ſo authorized. And the Scripture doth
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:8041:26"/>manifeſtly giue this power to Parents, when it ſaith to them, Giue your daughters to ſonnes, and take daughters for your ſonnes. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: You ſhall not giue your ſonnes to their daughters, nor take their daughters to your ſonnes. Therefore, me thinkes, it followes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably, that whom the Parents ioyne not, God doth not ioyne; and ſo their marriage is ſinfull, and their liuing together very filthineſſe and vncleanneſſe, vntill by ſubmiſſion they haue procured an after-conſent, to ratifie that, which ought not to haue been done before the conſent. And theſe bee the things which vnmarried men and women muſt principally looke vnto; all which we ſumme vp in this briefe manner: A man or woman, with the conſent of Parents (if there be any aliue) marrying a free perſon of the ſame true Religion, not touching him or her in too neere degrees of kindred or aſſinitie, marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth lawfully, and may ſay, as <hi>Paul, I haue married, and not ſinned.</hi> Thus the vnmarried haue heard their inſtructions.</p>

And that is ſanctified by thanksgiuing, for which the vſer (taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Gods goodneſſe and wiſdome, and other excellencies) doth returne the tribute of prayſe vnto him, aſcribing all honour and greatneſſe to him, as to the fountaine of all comfort. Now ſeeing he that is married, hath not ſinned in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, let him ſanctifie this lawfull ordinance vnto himſelfe, that hee may bee ſure to find the bleſſing of God vpon it, and vpon himſelfe.

A profane and licentious ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of good things at Gods hand, doth as much offend him, as wee are offended at the rude and vnmannerly behauiour of our ſeruants, when they come to receiue a good turne or gift from our hands, whereby wee are cauſed ſo to giue them the thing, as that wee doe alſo ſharpely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke them for their vndecent carriage. Things are not truly comfortable to the ſoule, neither doe they afford that ſpirituall fruit to a mans heart, which elſe they would, when his heart is ſo carnall, that he regardeth not to vſe them ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually. If marriage be looſely vſed, it will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a man to more looſeneſſe, and inflame thoſe paſſions, which it ſhould quench: it will breed a ſacietie and diſlike of each other in the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and make their affections to ſtraggle, ſo as they would rather accept of ſtrangers then themſelues. If marriage bee holily vſed, it will indeare the yoke-fellowes each to other, it will
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:8041:27"/>keepe their deſires in order, and cauſe that they ſhall be well ſatisfied each in other, as in Gods gifts. Neither can there bee any one truer rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon rendred, of the little good affection that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth betwixt many husbands and wiues, and of the little comfort they take each in other, then becauſe they abuſe Gods ordinance; and why ſhould he bleſſe it? Let it therefore bee obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued (by all thoſe that would keepe a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in all things, and doe deſire to approue themſelues honourers and fearers of God in their verie ſoules) that as wel marriage as food, muſt be made lawfull and profitable to them, by the Word and Prayer. And let it be alſo further vrged vpon the conſcience of the married, (that which nature it ſelfe will teach them,) that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord is pleaſed to allow them mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, they ſhould obediently accept of his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, and not imbolden themſelues, for their filthy luſts ſake, to take forbidden plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. If God, hauing planted in man that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall inclination which hee hath planted, for the increaſe of the world, ſhould haue debarred him matrimonie, it had been doubtleſſe an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt rigor in God, and would haue much exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate mans offences in that kind: but when he hath giuen an husband and a wife each to other, and commanded them to leaue all others, and cleaue vnto themſelues; now what excuſe haue they to alleage for their ſinne? Therefore let all married perſons reſolue to liue chaſtly, elſe ſhall the lawfulneſſe of matrimonie extremely
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:8041:28"/>aggrauate the ſinfulneſſe of their impuritie: for why ſhouldſt not thou (O man) be ſatisfied with thine owne wife, and thou (O woman) with thine owne husband? By taking Gods gift in marriage, thou neither rebelleſt againſt him, nor woundeſt thy conſcience, nor defileſt another, nor polluteſt thy ſelfe, nor breakeſt thy coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, nor wrongeſt thy family, nor tranſgreſſeſt the Lawes of men, nor diſhoneſteſt thy name, nor procureſt any other euill: But in imbracing a ſtranger, thou bringeſt infamie one thy name, a curſe vpon thy poſteritie, a ſinne vpon thy ſoule, and wrongeſ at once, God, the Church, the Commonweale, thy yoke-fellow, thy ſelfe, and many others moe. Ah, why ſhould a fooliſh and vnreaſonable fancy, ſo farre tranſport a man that hath vnderſtanding, as when the Lord affords him an honeſt, lawfull, blameleſſe, harmeleſſe, content; he ſhould neglect that, and preferre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, a reprochful, diſhoneſt, wicked, and bane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full pleaſure? As if a man, ſeeing two cups of wine, and know the one to bee wholeſome and vnmixed, ſhould let that ſtand ſtill, and drinke of another, which himſelfe did know to be poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned alone, becauſe the cup, perhaps, that contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the poyſon, were finelier wrought on the out-ſide. Or as if a man hauing ſufficient ſtore of money in his owne theſt, would not make vſe of that to buy neceſſaries, but goe and rob for it by the high-way ſide, that he might ſpend ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans money. The adulterer is a needleſſe thiefe, to whom it is no reaſon that any fauour
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:8041:28"/>ſhould be ſhewed. He may be compared to the man, that hauing ſtoe of Deere in his owne Parke, would yet needs ſteale a Buck out of his neighbours ground, becauſe hee was ſo folliſh as to glorie in his ſhame, and to bragge, that hee durſt ſteale one: What pitie could a man ſhew to ſuch an one, if either he ſhould miſcarry in his ſtealing, or bee ſeuerely puniſhed for his ſtealing? So the adulterer, that hauing a lawfull wife at home, ſhall giue his vnlawfull luſts ſcope to range abroad, to the wines or daughters of other men, is worthie all ſharpeneſſe of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as a man that hath hearkened to the orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of fooliſh folly, which perſwades her gueſts, ſaying, Stolne waters are ſweete, and hidden bread is pleaſant. But farre, farre be it from any Chriſtian man or woman, to poiſon and deſtroy themſelues with ſuch pleaſant bread, or ſweete waters. The pleaſures of filthineſſe are like the bread of deceite, which giueth a delightful rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh in the mouth, but is nothing elſe but verie grauell in the belly. Thou haſt ſolemnely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed before God, the Angels, and the Church, that forſaking all other, thou wilt keepe thee onely to thine owne yoke-fellow. Seeing God hath allowed thee this comfort, wallow not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in forbidden pleaſures. And for the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of marriage, ſo much. I come now to ſpeake of its troubleſomneſſe, which few will beleeue, till they find; and few can beare, when they haue found.</p>

                        </label> The cauſe then is ſinne; ſinne (I ſay) the make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate betwixt God and man, which with-draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the creature from his loyaltie to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, cauſeth the Creator in iuſtice to with-draw his fauour from the creature, and in ſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to purſue him with his curſe. This curſe, as it made the frutifull earth to bring forth briers and thornes (which elſe ſhould neuer haue affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſuch vnprofitable and hurtfull increaſe) ſo hath alſo filled all eſtates with ſtirres and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions, as it were, brambles. Wherefore as any eſtate doth occaſion any perſon to intermeddle with more buſineſſes, and with more perſons; ſo is it alſo moleſted with more troubles, through the vnhappie working of the actuall corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all parties (to the annoyance of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) vnreaſonably diſcouering themſelues. If man had continued in his due loyaltie towards his King and Maker, neither Matrimonie, nor any other condition of life ſhould haue diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him with any the leaſt touch of miſerie. But juſtice requireth, that Rebels and rebellion bee puniſhed. Sinne is the ſore ſawce that diſtaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all our comforts; this is like the Colloquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:8041:30"/>in the pot of pottage, which the Prophets ſeruants had made, that cauſed the eaters to crie out, <hi>Death is in the pot.</hi> This is that ſtinking weed, which diſſauours all our ſweete flowres: This is the imbitterer of all eſtates, bringing forth ſuch, and ſo many diſorders in men and women, as make them to bring forth trouble each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In marriage, a man is ingaged to more bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes and duties, then before; occaſioned to deale with more humours, then before; and to ſtand in need of more things, then before; ſo will ſinne and corruption ſhew it ſelfe more, then before; and ſo muſt he meete with more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, then before. This I ſpeake, to free both God, the Author of Marriage; as alſo Marriage, his ordinance, from all manner of blame and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations. For if all the hardneſſe wherewith we be moleſted, doe grow from our ſinne, and our ſinne ariſe from Satans temptation, and the abuſe of our owne free will, as all theſe things are moſt vndoubted and certaine, why ſhould God be faulted for our miſerie, ſeeing hee made vs not miſerable, til we had made ourſelues ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full? And why ſhould any eſtate of life be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for our miſerie, ſeeing if wee were not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in it, we ſhould not reape any miſerie from it?</p>
                     <p>Take notice then of the true cauſe of all the cumbers,<note place="margin">An explication to the point.</note> which incumber married people; and ſecondly, let mee informe you alſo, at leaſt of ſome, and the chiefe troubles of marriage, which you muſt know, that you may expect them; and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:8041:30"/>expect them, that you may prepare for them; and prepare for them, that you may not be made impatient by them; and by impatiencie, make them much more cumbrous, then elſe they need to be. Theſe doe all ariſe from foure maine heads: The perſons married, their children, their ſeruants, and their eſtates; of all which a man might ſpend more then foure dayes in ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, it taking counſell of experience, he would borrow a little help of Rhetorick, to ſet out the matters to the full; but I will alone touch them, and away. Euerie man and woman haue their faults: thoſe will breede trouble: they may bee ſicke, and that is another trouble: one of the two die firſt, and leaue the other behind, and that is to ſome the worſt of all troubles. In the ſoules of men there breed vices; in their bodies, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; and at laſt, death; and the fruit of all theſe muſt needs be griefe and ſorrow each to other. Some men are churliſh, ſowre, &amp; vnkind; ſome, wrathfull, paſſionate, and furious; ſome hard, miſerable, and niggardly; ſome waſtefull, rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and vnthriftie; ſome vncleane, vnſatiable, and ranging after other women; ſome ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious, miſtruſtfull, and iealous of their owne wiues; ſome raſh and hare-brain'd; ſome fond and giddie; ſome ſimple; ſome ſubtill; ſome idle; ſome toyleſome; ſome carking; ſome careleſſe; yea, twentie, and twice twentie ſinfull and offending diſpoſitions, ſhew themſelues in all the ſonnes of <hi>Adam;</hi> and what woman can meete with a man in all the world, in whom
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:8041:31"/>ſome or other of theſe diſorders doe not dwell? Nature and education may hide them out of the way, that they ſhall not bee ſeene; Grace and ſanctification may in part ſubdue them, that they ſhall not reigne: but neither nature, nor grace, ſhall quite and cleane aboliſh them, that they ſhall not bee; and to obtaine an husband free from all of them (yea, not ſubiect to more then one, two, or three of them,) it is altogether impoſſible; and as impoſſible to liue with one that hath them (though neuer ſo much mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the ſtate of men on earth can reach) and not be troubled, &amp; exceedingly troubled with them, as to go bare-foot vpon a ricke of thornes or furres, and not bee pricked and pained with them.</p>
                     <p>In like ſort, ſome women are proud, arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, and ſcornefull; ſome, violent, head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong, and maſterfull; ſome, ſullen and dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; ſome, ſcolding and ſnappiſh; ſome, talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue; ſome, tongue-tied; ſome, light; ſome, coy; ſome, finiſh; ſome, ſluttiſh; ſome, ouer-ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; ſome, ouer-ſparing; ſome, lewd and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſte; ſome, raging and iealous: yea, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and a thouſand faults, doe lie hid in the painted box of the boſome of euerie of <hi>Euahs</hi> daughters. Good bringing vp may conceale them; good inſtructions may diminiſh; and good nature, for a while, may keep them vnder, and keepe them ſecret: yea, the worke of grace may mortifie, quell, and ouer-maſter them; but nothing can altogether roote them out, ſo long
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:8041:31"/>as fleſh and ſpirit do ſtriue together in one ſoule; that is, ſo long as ſoule and bodie doe liue toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this life. A woman void of ſome, yea, diuers of theſe faults and follies, no care, no paines, no diligence, can helpe a man vnto; and from trouble by theſe faults, where they haue a being, and a working: no wiſdome, no loue, no pietie, can altogether free him, more then from being ſtung by the handling of Nettles with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked hands. It were good therefore for the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that is to marrie, to put her ſelfe in mind of theſe things before-hand, and to demand of her ſelfe in theſe, or the like queſtions: What if mine husband ſhould proue vnkind, and diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardfull of me? What if hee ſhould bee bitter and ragefull towards me? What if hee ſhould rate me with words of diſgrace, more then euer my Father or Maſter haue done? What if hee ſhould lay vpon me with his vnmanlike fiſt? and that when I ſeeke to giue him all content? Or what if he ſhould ſtrike mee with a more paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and miſchieuous weapon, though I gaue him no cauſe? How ſhould I beare railing, taunting, or cutting termes, at his mouth? How cruell, fierce, and cauſeleſſe blowes at his hand? But yeeld that he proue not ſo mad, and mankind; How if it fall out yet, that he be careleſſe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind? What if hee denie me the reaſonable li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie which I deſire, and ſhould enioy? and will not ſuffer me to haue my wil in things conuenient? How if he ſhew me a lowring counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and an eſtranged carriage, and that alſo
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:8041:32"/>vndeſeruedly? How if he grumble and grudge at mine expences, though farre from being la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſh and immoderate? What if hee bee toyle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome himſelfe, and put me alſo to harder labour, then euer I endured, being a daughter or a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant? What if he thinke much to allow me ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie helpes and comforts, in my weakeneſſe, ſickneſſes, and lying in, and be then moſt vnkind, when I need moſt kindnes, becauſe his niggard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humour can beare no charges? Or what if he bee diuers, and tetchie, ſo that nothing in the world can pleaſe him, but he will ſtill be braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, chiding, and finding fault, though I bee as carefull as I can, to ekepe my ſelfe from faults? Or what if he proue a voluptuarie, a drunkard, an epicure, ſpending that riotouſly, and waſtefully, which were better ſaued, to prouide for me and his children? What if he be an haunter of Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, or Tauernes, and come home half drunk, halfe mad, and powre forth all his rage vpon me and my innocent children? What if he conſume himſelfe in ſports, paſtimes, and gaming, and make vs all beggers by his vnthriftineſſe? How could I ſuffer all, or any of theſe troubles, in the fleſh? How tedious? How bitter? How terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble would they ſeeme vnto me? Or, What if out of an hatefull ouer-louingneſſe, hee make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſuſpicious of mine honeſtie, and (in a furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and blind apprehenſion of, I know not what, ſlender probabilities) bee euer vpbraiding mee with being ſuch a mans whore, and ſuch a mans whore? How keene? How cutting? How ſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:8041:32"/>How piercing would theſe termes be vnto me? But, ah, what if he ſhould become vncleane and filthie? giuen to whoredome, imbracing the boſome of ſtrangers, and bringing home vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me the feare, if not the feeling of loathſome diſeaſes? How ſhould I vndergoe this heauie burden, which yet I ſee many compeld to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe without remedie? Thus ſhould the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man conſider before-hand in her thoughts, the euils that may be fall her in marriage.</p>
                     <p>So like wiſe ſhould the husband bethink him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his moſt ſerious thoughts: What if my wife ſhould proue careleſſe, and vnhuſwifely, wanting forecaſt and skill to make the beſt of things, and ſo become an hindrance, rather then an helper to mine eſtate? What if ſhe bee dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and lauiſh, and will not content her ſelfe with mine attire and my fare? What if ſhee bee ſluttiſh and vncleanely, and worke loathing in mee, by the ill ordering of thoſe things that ſhould giue me moſt comfort? What if ſhe bee froward and ſnappiſh, and returne my words vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee with aduantage? What if ſhee proue a blab, and withall inquiſitiue, ſo that ſhe will bee ignorant of nothing, and yet can keepe no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell? What if ſhe be ſullen, and ſowre, and will giue me no good counenance, vnleſſe ſhe haue her vnreaſonable will performed in all things? What if ſhe waſte my goods in vaine, coſtlineſſe of attire, and in idle meetings amongſt her Gof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fips? What if ſhe be looſe and wanton, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit my family with an euill name? What if
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:8041:33"/>ſhe be a very harlot, and defile my bed, and fill mine houſe with baſtards, ſo that I bee faine to breed vp y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſeed of an adulterer, in ſtead of mine owne off-ſpring? What if ſhe be miſchieuouſly iealous, and thinke that I am naught with all I ſpeake to, laying whoredome to my charge, when I neuer meant it, and almoſt inforce me to bee wicked, by putting that into mine head, which I neuer dreamt of? How ſhould I brooke this life? How ſhould I ſuſtaine this burden, and vndergoe this trouble to the fleſh? And this for the vices of the mind, whereby many times a bad husband, or a bad wife, doe vexe and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their yoke-fellow.</p>
                     <p>But if the mind be not infected with theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſeaſes, yet may the bodie proue weake and ſickly, and become little leſſe trouble ſome. Wherefore of this alſo ſhould the woman con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider well before-hand, and ſo ſhould the man. What if mine husband ſhould languiſh away in paine and ſickneſſe, ſo that my life muſt be ſpent in attending a body ſtill dying, and as it were, vnder-propping a rotten houſe alwaies falling? What if he lye thus by me groning, and toſſing, many dayes, weekes, moneths, and ſome yeeres? How ſhal I vndergoe the watching, attendance, charge, griefe, diſcomfort of an husband, neither dead nor aliue, but betwixt both? Or for mine owne part, What if breeding be roubleſome, ſo that I ſcarce enioy an healthie day from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to quickning, from quickning to trauel? What if bringing forth be ſo tedious and paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:8041:33"/>that I neuer become a mother, but by going thorow the torment of an hundred deaths in one, beſides a long weakeneſſe after? What if God multiply my ſorrowes this way, and giue me an euill ſtomacke, pale cheekes, a wan coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enance, faint legs, and a feeble body, liker a carceſſe, then a liuing woman? How ſhall I beare head-ach, heart-ach, back-ach, ſtomack-ach, etching, caſting, longing, loathing, quawmes, pangs, ſwoundings, and twentie deaths a day?</p>
                     <p>The husband alſo ſhould thinke thus: How if my wife become infirme and feeble, lame, impotent, powerleſſe, able neither to got, nor keepe, to labour, nor ouer-fee, nor to doe any thing, but groane, and ſigh, and hold her ſides, and keepe her bed, to mine exceſſiue charge and griefe, without being any way able to be an help and comfort vnto mee? With what patience ſhould I heare her groanes? With what quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhould I looke vpon her pangs, and euen be ſicke in her ſickneſſe? But in concluſion, death wil approach, and diuorce the husband and wife each from other, of which, either ſhould thinke before it come to either, yea, before themſelues come together: How can I tell (may the wife ſay,) but that if I be married to this husband, hee may leaue me the mother of ſome children, and nwo great with another, and (ſending his ſoule to heauen) giue me alone his cold corpſe to put into the earth? How ſhall I doe to ſee the breath goe out of that beloued body? How ſhall I endure to ſee thoſe eyes clozed, and all thoſe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:8041:34"/>lims and ioynts now vnder the arreſt of death? How ſhould I beare the deſolate name of a wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow? of one that had an husband? where the croſſe is aggrauated by the goodneſſe of him, whom I haue loſt?</p>
                     <p>So muſt the husband thinke: What if either in trauaile, or otherwiſe, the Lord do take away my deare wife from my ſide? What if ſhe liue with me but a few dayes, and then death come and make an irrecouerable ſeparation? How ſhall I behold thoſe cheekes wan, thoſe lips black, thoſe hands cold, that body breathles and liueleſſe, and fit for none other habitation, but that of wormes, the darke graue, the Kingdome of corruption, the territorie of rottennes? How ſhall I lay that beloued body, forſaken of the more beloued ſoule, into the bowels and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trals of the all deuouring ſepulchre? Indeed, brethren, ſo farre as I ſee, now adayes men and women can well enough anſwer to theſe queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for they can burie and marrie, and all in a moneth, an haſtineſſe deſeruing to bee deepely cenſured. But if thou loue thine husband; if thouloue thy wife, how canſt thou brooke this finall ſeparation? But we goe forward, to ſhew you the troubles you may meete with, in reſpect of children.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes barrenneſſe doth cloze vp the wombe, and ſuffers not the married perſons to become parents. Sometimes the fruit of the bodie is granted indeed, but blaſted with ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and with ſpeedy death. Sometimes they
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:8041:34"/>liue but a few dayes, or a few yeeres, and then leaue the parent more ſorrie for the leſſe, then glad at the receiuing of them. Sometimes they liue to mans age, and out-liue the parents, but onely to be their parents tormentors and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, by their euill and lewd conditions, ſo diſquieting their hearts, that they would count it an aduantage to haue been barren, and doe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten wiſh they had laid them in thier graues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore euer they had vſed a tongue to ſpeake. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a child puts his mother to after-throes more terrible, then thoſe with which ſhee brought him into the world at firſt. Many a father is in trauaile of his old child, that knew not the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of his firſt bringing forth. Sometimes they proue ſtubburne, ſometimes riotous, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times vncleane, ſometimes falſe, and ſometimes bring themſelues to infamous puniſhments, and vntimely deaths. Sometimes they belewd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore marriage, and vexe the parents, with behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a baſtard of their names. Sometimes they be wilfull inmarriage, and wil make their owne fooliſh choyce, againſt the knowledge or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of parents. Set them to learning, they learne nothing but vanitie: ſet them to labour, they labour for nothing, but to vndoe themſelues; running away from their Maſters; it may be alſo robbing them; and hauing runne themſelues out of breath, come home ragged, and miſerable, but not penitent, ready to doe as bad againe, and put their parents to extremitie of care; ſo that they are euen diſtraced, and at their wits ends, not
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:8041:35"/>knowing what courſe in the world to take with them, becauſe both faire meanes and foule meanes haue been vſed, and none will auaile. Sometimes againe, a child ſeeming towardly, ſo wins away the parents affection, that hee giues him almoſt his whole eſtate, and is content to be at his finding; and then loe, the monſtrous Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per begrudgeth his parents food and attire, is wearie of his old age, and counts his weakeneſſe ouer-cumbrous, and ſticketh not to ſhew by words and deeds, that hee wiſheth his death with all his heart; then which (I think) no croſſe in a child can be more ſtinging.</p>
                     <p>Thinke of theſe things, you that are, or would be married: What if you prooue drie Kyes, and beare no fruite? How could you brooke a life wanting iſſue, the moſt deſireable fruit of marriage? Or, What if God giue thee children to looke vpon for a weeke, or two? or to play with for a yeere or two? or to be charged with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all for a doozen, or a ſcore of yeeres, and then ſend death to fetch them to himſelfe againe? With what quietneſe of mind couldſt thoui re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne theſe gifts into the hand of him that gaue them? How couldeſt thou endure, to ſee the ſickneſſe of thy ſonnes or daughters, to ſee them burne, toffe, tumble, waſte, conſume, languiſh, and pine away? to heare them grone, ſigh, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, crie out, and roare, and ſcritch, and fill thine eares with rufull lamentations? How canſt thou frame thy ſelfe, to ſee thy branches, as it were withering, halfe cut off, and ready to fall
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:8041:35"/>from the body of thy family? What ſhift couldſt thou make to burie two, three, foure, halfe a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, halfe a ſcore ſonnes or daughters, ſome at a day, ſome at a weeke, ſome at a yeere, ſome at a dozen, ſome at twentie, or more yeeres old? Or if thou ſcape theſe petit croſſes, in thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, how couldſt thou brooke a ſtubburne, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious ſon, or daughter, that will interchange words with thee, and ſnap thee vp ſhort, and chide faſter then thy ſelfe? that will caſt vpon thee a leering, horſe-like, contemptuous eye? and will ſtab thy ſoule, with a lowring, pouting, ſcornefull looke? with a dogged, barking an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere? yea, that will ſteale thy goods from thee, and conſume it in ill company, whores, and drunkenneſſe? that waſtes all that thou haſt gotten, and giuen to him? and takes ſuch vnta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med courſes, as doe deeply threaten thine heart and eyes with that worſe then deadly ſpectacle, to ſee him one day preaching vpon a ladder, with a rope about his necke, becauſe ſuch a life can hardly conclude in a better death? How wilt thou ſuffer this corzie of a wicked, riotous, vngracious, vngratefull Viper in thine houſe? who doth nothing elſe, but ſtriue with abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble words and deeds, as it were with poyſonfull teeth, to gnaw out thy verie heart, and deuoure thy bowels and entrals; for whom, thou canſt neither eate, or ſleepe in quiet; nor be at home nor abroad in peace; a very <hi>Abſalom,</hi> that would kill his father, to get his Kingdome? With what reſolution could you parents vnder-goe the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:8041:36"/>of a good child, or the liuing of a bad? But let it be granted, that a mans children ſhall proue at leaſt indifferent and tolerable; there is yet another neceſſarie member of a family, which may make the hear of the family ake ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly; theſe are ſeruants of both ſexes, men and maides. Some ſeruants be idle, and ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and will doe little; ſome be hollow and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitefull, and will doe nothing but when the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours eye is vpon them; ſome be rude and rebellious, and will doe what they luſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues for all their gouernours ſpeeches; ſome bee falſe and vntruſtie, and will purloyne their goods if they can; ſome be careleſſe and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and procure exceeding loſſe by their negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; ſome bee riotous and waſtefull, haue a ſweete tooth, and will haue their good cheare of their Maſters coſt, but without his priuitie; ſome bee ſtragglers, licentious, out-lyers, that lodge not in their Maſters families on nights, but frequent their meetings in the time of ſleep, and take their ſleepe in the time of working; ſome he ſurly and ſawcie, and will deſerue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofes oft enough, but will neuer recerue them with patience. Some are ſoft and ſlow, and though they ſeeme to be willing, yet are able to diſpatch little; ſome be ſimple and indiſcreete, and will bee doing, but without fore-ſight and wiſdome, and ſo doe little to the purpoſe; ſome bee quarrelſome and ſnarling, and alwaies ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king brawles with their fellow ſeruants, which needs muſt end in their maſters loſſe on both
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:8041:36"/>ſides. Now let all that affect marriage, aske themſelues, What ſhift ſhould I make to beare with a ſlow, drumbling, lazie ſeruant, whoſe worke is not worth his meate, but he goes about his buſineſſe, euen iuſt like as a tyred horſe, faire and ſoftly? Or how ſhould I breake a ſeruant, as nimble of his tongue, as of his hands, that will bee my maſter, and haue his owne way in all things, or elſe hee will diſpatch nothing? that wil be as lowd as my ſelfe, if I begin to reproue, and tell me plainely, that he will not mend for chiding, and I ſee plainely, that he wil not mend without it? How ſhould I liue with an vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident, heedleſſe ſeruant, that will loſe more on a day, then his labour is worth in a moneth? and lets all things goe to wreck and ruine vnder his hands, onely for want of paines and care, that is euer grumbling at his work, and diſliking of his diet, and ſtill thinks that his labour is too paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and his fare too hard; that will prig, ſteale, and lie, and cares not how hee coozens me, ſo that he can either impudently out-face, or craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily beguile me? In a word, How could I beare ſlothfulnes, ſullennes, waſtefulnes, careleſnes, whereof ſome are in all, and all in moſt ſeruants? How could I ſuffer this affliction in the fleſh, which thoſe that are married, can hardly eſcape? And now leauing the perſons in the family, let vs conſider the things thereof, euen the whole eſtate of men, and ſee what burdens may thence bee caſt vpon the ſhoulders of the married cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:8041:37"/>
                     <p>Who doth not know, how troubleſome a thing it is to want neceſſaries; and withall, how common of thoſe, which when they liued in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle life, abounded in all things, and neuer knew (nor thought they ſhould know) what it was to neede a penny, but haue fared abundantly, and been attired comelily, and had ſtill ſomething to ſpare, for the ſatisfying of their owne deſires? Very many after marriage, be put into the cloſe ſtocks of miſerie, want, and neceſſitie, not hauing wherewithall to prouide conuenient foode and rayment for themſelves, and for their charge, which vnawares, and without fore-ſight, is now growne heauie vpon them. It is an eaſie thing to fill one belly, and cloath one backe, and keepe ſomething in the purſe, when but one hand muſt fetch out of it: but to prouide diet and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire for a wife, for many ſmall children, for ſome ſeruants; to pay for houſe-rent, and fewell, and candle; to disburſe the compelled charges of the weakneſſe of a wife, of children, of ſeruants, and to bring vp many with the fruite of one mans labour and induſtrie; this doth oftentimes prooue farre leſſe eaſie, then men in imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can deeme it to be. Neither doth this neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie attend alone vpon perſons of lower ranke, that muſt get their liuing by their fingers ends, and liue vpon their hard and toyleſome labour; but many a man alſo, that flouriſheth at firſt, with a good ſtocke of his owne, and a good por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his wiues, at laſt, by meanes of croſſes and loſſes in diuers kinds, doth runne thorow
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:8041:37"/>all, and (prouing banquerupt,) ends his dayes in a priſon, and leaueth his wife and children to be poorely prouided for, by the cold bountie of friends, or the common ſtocke of the Towne or Pariſh: yea, many a man that hath houſe and land of his owne in good quantitie, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelfe a liberall maintenance, doth yet meete with ſo many hindrances, by loſſe of cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, ill bargaines, ill debtors, ill ſeruants, or his owne fore-ſightleſneſſe, that before hee thinkes of it, euen on a ſudden, he runs into debt and danger, and ſtickes ſo faſt in the Vſurers Waxe, that he cannot winde himſelfe out againe, vntill his dying day? How often is it ſeene in the world, that riches proue like wilde-fowle, to him, on whoſe buſhes they ſate for a little time, and (taking the aduantage of his careleſneſſe, or other inauoydeable croſſes) doe flie quite from him, and neuer returne againe? yea, euen of thoſe which are not abſolute beggers, yet many runne ſo farre in debt, and are ſo intangled with borrowing and lending, that their intangled e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate doth become extremely troubleſome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they want things neceſſarie to maintaine themſelues according to their owne ranke; though for a man of another condition of life, the things they poſſeſſe, would euen more then ſuffice. Runne thorow an whole Towne and Countrie, enquire into all the houſholds, and ſearch into all the eſtates of the greater number, and you ſhall find them broken, incumbred, low, deiected, and euen ſticking faſt in the mud and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:8041:38"/>mire of want and penurie. Need then fighteth againſt the ſonnes of men with eagerneſſe, and (like an harneſſed man) doth vſe violence, &amp; will not be repelled, but by great labor, &amp; great care, and continuall diligence; in which ſtrife, though a man get the better, and ſaue himſelf fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> falling into the hands of pouertie, yet (as it were a blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy victorie) it giues him little cauſe to reioyce in the conqueſt. Married men muſt care for the things of this world, how to pleaſe their yoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellowes, how to maintaine their families, how to liue amongſt their neighbours, how to pay e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie man his owne; how to get ſomething for their children; in which care, though they proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſo much, as to bring to paſſe the thing cared for, yet is the labour great, and the burthen hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, and the trouble much vnto the fleſh. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſingle perſon muſt vſe his eyes to look, before hee leape, and muſe thus with himſelfe: Now I am a child, or ſeruant, I haue all things in ſtore and plentie; I haue none to care for, but my ſelfe, or ſcarce my ſelfe to care for, being maintained rather by the care of others, then of my ſelfe: when euer I ſhall marrie, the caſe will be much altered; I muſt take paines, and vſe forecaſt for my ſelfe, and for many others, beſides my ſelfe: I muſt get food for children, and wages for ſeruants; I muſt looke that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing bee loſt, but that ſomething may be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; mine head muſt guide all, mine eyes muſt ſee all, mine hand muſt be ſet to euery chare, and nothing will goe well forward, vnleſſe my ſelfe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:8041:38"/>doe put a finger, or rather a ſhoulder to it. What ſhould I doe, if God ſhould croſſe mee, and the World frowne vpon mee? How ſhould I ſuffer ſuch extreme penurie, as ſuch and ſuch haue done before me? How ſhould I goe (as it were in a ſhoo too ſtraight for my foote) in a ſtate too little for my mind and education, as ſuch and ſuch haue done? How ſhould I deſcend to coorſer fare, to meaner attire, to ſmaller at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, to leſſer reſpect, then what I was wont to enioy, in the houſe of my Maſter, or my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents? How ſhould I doe to make hard ſhifts, to borrow of one, to pay another, to labour, and toyle, and buy, and ſell, and liue by the loſſe? and to ſee mine eſtate ſtill tumbling lower &amp; lower, as one, whoſe foote hath ſlipped on the ſide of a ſteepe hill, that can neuer recouer himſelfe, till he come to the bottome? Oh, how painefull is it to ſtriue with a broken eſtate, yea, or to keepe an whole eſtate from breaking? If the wife be not huſwifely, if the ſeruants bee not truſtie, if neighbours be not honeſt, if ſucceſſe be not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie; how eaſily will the ſea of wants breake in vpon me? and how much adoe ſhall I haue to ſwim againſt the ſtreame, and ſaue my ſelfe from being euen drowned in penurie and neede? To ſee the ſtate goe back ward, is a great trouble; to make it ſtand at a ſtay, or goe forward, is a great trouble: How ſhall I bee able to wreſtle with all theſe difficulties? And ſo at laſt (my Brethren) haue I paſſedouer this rugged way, and in going along, haue pointed you at a few of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:8041:39"/>the many encumbrances, that, like euill waiting-men, doe preſſe themſelues in with the ſtate of Matrimonie: and know you, that this which we haue ſpoken, is but, as it were, a Map before your eyes, or as an imperfect narration, of a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and troubleſome voyage, which your experience will make you feele, to be ten times more troubleſome, then any words can deſcribe it. And now I will go on to giue you ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, from this moſt approued, and moſt plainely manifeſted truth.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd this troubleſomenes of marriage, giues cauſe of giuing counſell to the vnmarried perſons, as alſo to the married. The former muſt bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed to vſe warineſſe afore marrying, and to prouide themſelues well for each of theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, when they doe marrie. The other muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour ſo farre as is poſſible, to preuent the troubles, and to be thankfull, if his lot haue been to meete but with few, or at leaſt, the eaſieſt of them. Now then, thoſe amongſt you that are yet ſingle, muſt be taught to lay this point well to heart, that they may keepe themſelues from an vnneceſſarie haſtineſſe to enter vpon this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance; I meane, before they be called of God
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:8041:39"/>thereto; that is, before they haue carefully vſed all other meanes of ouer-ruling themſelues. It fals out many times, that raſh and vndiſcreete Youths (finding a little trouble, in being ſubiect to their Parents and Maſters) entertaine a ſtrong conceite, how happily they ſhould liue, if they were married. Hence, hauing ſo ſhallow and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a braine, as not to bee able to conceiue of more, in diſcourſe of reaſon, then they can ſee and feele with their bodily ſences, by and by they runne together, come of it what will, and afterwards wiſh booteleſly, that they had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their former eſtate with more contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: yea, ſome that haue liued long in virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and ſee almoſt all their youngers married before them, and therefore alſo ſet aboue them in meetings, and more familiarly entertained then themſelues (not knowing how hard a peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth this honour is to them, that haue paid for it) are moued with enuie, to become wiues or husbands, and (as if it were a diſparagement for them, to haue liued virgins) doe but euen long for an offer, to make an ill bargaine, and ſell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their owne reſt, for a thing of nothing. And there are found alſo in the world ſome perſons, that no ſooner feele a little mouing of naturall deſires to the wedded condition, but that they yeeld ſtraight to their own luxurious fancies, &amp; will neuer be at paines to reſiſt ſuch motions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they deſire rather to ſatisfie them. Now al ſuch perſons ſhould be perſwaded to take into their thoughts, &amp; to conſider moſt aduiſedly of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:8041:40"/>theſe words of the Apoſtle; <hi>Such ſhall haue trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the fleſh.</hi> Marriage is a Roſe indeed, of ſweet ſmell, of goodly hiew; but it wants not its Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, to fetch blood of their fingers, that are ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eager to crop it. It is a day not all our ſo faire and ſun-ſhine, but that a man may be wet to the skin, with the ſtormes that ariſe in it before the euening. Wherefore before a man reſolue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an entrance into this eſtate, let him lay both ends together, as they vſe to ſpeake; let him caſt all things into the ballance of his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and then iudge indifferently, and out of the direction of reaſon take that courſe, which ſhall bee moſt for his comfort. Thou are now wearie of being vnder the command of a gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; If thou be a maid, take heed thou meete not with a worſe gouernour, and more haſtie, though bearing a fairer title; If thou be a man, beware thou meete not with one to gouerne, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſhall be ten times more hard and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to rule, then to pleaſe almoſt any ruler. It is tedious to thee, that thoſe are now wiues, which were girles when thou waſt marriageable; and husbands which were boyes, when thou waſt growne to mans eſtate; thou thinkeſt it much, that they carrie away the account from thee, and are in ſhew more ſet by. Well, take heed, leſt in catching after ſuch honour, thou ſtumble not vpon ſo many troubles, as ſhall make thee wiſh again, to ſit at the lower end of the boord, and to giue place to thy youngers in ſuch comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, rather then to bee equall with them in
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:8041:40"/>ſuch cumbers. Thou findeſt it a warre within thy ſelfe to keep downe luſt; take heed it be not a greater warre, when marriage hath aſſwaged luſt, to keepe downe impatient riſings at the troubles of marriage, or to hold vp thine heart againſt ſinking, and diſcouragement vnder thoſe troubles. This eſtate (as ſure as <hi>Paul</hi> was a wiſe man, and a true ſpeaker) hath as much ſowre as ſweete; as many bitter morſels, as pleaſant; as much tribulation, as contentment: trie it who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo well, have ſhall neuer find the Apoſtle falſe. Therefore be not a foole, to take vp thy ſelfe with an ouer-greedie thinking of the benefits thou lookeſt for, not troubling thy ſelfe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fider the miſeries alſo, that will affront thee: but looke well to both, and take notice of both, and accept of that, which iudgement ſhall moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline thee to, not which paſſion. I confeſſe, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, it is a certaine truth, that our Apoſtle hath before deliuered in this Chapter; <hi>Better marrie, then burne:</hi> That is to ſay, bee perpetually mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted with an inconquerable deſire of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. And therefore I pray you conceiue of theſe my words, as nothing contrarie to thoſe I ſpake in the former point; for this exhortation and that, belong to different kinds of men. If thou beeſt one that feeleſt in thy ſelfe a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of marriage, if thou beeſt one, whoſe bodily conſtitution is ſuch, that the beſt meanes wil not otherwiſe keepe thy mind in a well-contented chaſtitie, then lay aſide all the feare of troubles; and pray to God to prouide thee of a fit yoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>follow,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:8041:41"/>fellow, and accordingly endeauour (after his counſell, and with his bleſſing) to enter into this eſtate. But if thou find power ouer thy ſelfe, and canſt be maſter of thine owne will, and haſt the ruling hand ouer thine owne affections, ſo as though ſome motions doe ariſe within thee, yet they be neither many, nor violent, nor any, but ſuch, as quickly with a little abſtinence, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent prayer, thou canſt quench and keepe downe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> breaking forth into a flame of ſinfull wiſhes or attempts; now doe thou conſider of <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpeeches, embrace the more eaſie kind of liuing. Gallop not into a brake of thornes, from which thou canſt find no way out; and bee not ouer-venturous to ruſh vpon trouble. Let not a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine fooliſh wearineſſe to bee vnder gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; let not a fond conceit, that it is a reproach to thee, to continue ſo ancient a Maid, or Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelor; let not a veyne of enuie to ſee others wedded, and thy ſelfe (their elder) liuing ſingle; let not the deſire of accompliſhing thine owne deſires, or of following the example of others; let not a lothneſſe to labour for the gift of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencie; let none of all theſe things, nor any like to them, perſwade thee to flie to marriage; that is to ſay, to leaue reſt and eaſe, and runne vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on trouble. Beware, my brethren, of accounting that a carnall reaſon, which you ſee to be Gods reaſon. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> argues thus; Better bee ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle (if you can without ſinne) becauſe marriage is a ſtate of more affliction.) It is (you ſee) a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, holy, ſpirituall reaſon, beſeeming the pen of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:8041:41"/>him that was inſpired from aboue, we may well take boldneſſe to inforce it vpon your thoughts, and to tell you, that you erre exceedingly, if you count it either a weake, or a fleſhly reaſon: for wee all confeſſe, that the God of Heauen vſeth neither falſe nor weake reaſons. You may, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, tell me, that <hi>Paul</hi> meant it of thoſe times of perſecutions, and not of all times indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But I can certainly tel you, that you ſhall find, he meant it of all times indifferently, though it be principally true of ſuch times. The preſent neceſſitie is not to be reſtrained to the dayes of open perſecution, but enlarged to the diſtreſſes of this preſent life: for elſe the argument had been vnfitly framed for the ſtate of the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, ſeeing at this time they were not aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with any ſuch te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peſtuous weather. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will be bold to vndertake, to perſwade all you vnmarried people, Widdowes, Maids, Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelors, Widdowers, if you can, without the farre greater miſchiefe of burning; that is to ſay, of being carried away with vnſubduable wiſhes of this kind, to keepe you as you be, and not to procure miſerie to your ſelues by a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe change of your eſtates. You may, perhaps, imagine, that the comforts of marriage will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly requite the troubles. So all things ſeeme faire afarre off, which are not ſo neerer hand: but if you will be well aduiſed before you conclude, you ſhall find, that indeed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts are not worth the troubles. For I pray you, what be the comforts you talke of? A wife,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:8041:42"/>children: theſe two be all, and yet I haue told you before, that often theſe two bee the greateſt cumbers of marriage; ſo that theſe are but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine comforts, and may proue otherwiſe. But ſay that they prooue in the beſt ſort; yet I aſſure you, that they are farre too light, to ouer-weigh all the leaden weights of trouble that lye in the other ſcale. If a wife be vnto thee a remedie againſt ſinne, and a preſeruatiue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt fornication; I yeeld indeed, that the good that thou haſt by her, doth farre more then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence all the miſeries that marriage brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth with it: and if thou haue lawfull children in Wedlock, to ſaue thee from hauing miſ-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten children in whoredome; now thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren doe ſufficiently requite all thy paines, care, trouble about them, and thine eſtate for them. But if thou haſt the abilitie of containing, and couldeſt without danger of ſinne forbeare Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie, I am in mind, that all the comfort which the beſt husband, or the beſt wife, and the beſt children can afford thee, by their beſt loue, dutie, and good affection, can no more counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile the troubles of marriage, then the childs ſmiling and laughing in the morning can coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teruaile the Nurces breach of ſleepe all night. If it were otherwiſe, <hi>Pauls</hi> argument were not good: He diſſwades marriage to them that can containe, becauſe it is more troublous. If it brought comforts beyond the ſingle eſtate, which did exceed the cumbers it bringeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that eſtate, our Apoſtle had made a feeble
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:8041:42"/>and ineffectuall reaſon: for who cannot ſay, that what brings more profit, then loſſe, muſt be done, though it bring ſome loſſe? And what brings more comfort, then trouble, muſt rather be done, though it bring ſome trouble. Indeed, you muſt conceiue, that the Apoſtle here doth ſpeake of things, as moſt times, and vſually they fall out; not intending to point at euery parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular paire of wedded people, that euer ſhall be; but, for the moſt part, for the far greater number of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Marriage is a fea, that yeeldeth more toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, then the land would doe by farre. You may thinke then; How commeth it to paſſe, that ſo many doe marrie continually? I anſwere, Firſt, becauſe the moſt are led by example, or paſſion, and doe that in haſte, which they repent by leiſure. And againe: The Lord (that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to ſtore the World, and made man, not to take eaſe, but to doe ſeruice, though it bee with trouble) doth not afford to moſt men, the gift of continencie. But all thoſe men or women, to whom this ſingular and excellent gift is affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, let them take their reſt, when God giues them leaue, and not beare a yoke when they may go free.</p>
                     <p>Some will obiect, that we ſeeme to ſet Gods honour below troubles; for Marriage encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth mankind, the encreaſe whereof, is more to Gods glorie.</p>
                     <p>I anſwere theſe perſons, That <hi>Paul</hi> was as carefull of Gods glorie, as they can bee, and yet he diſſwadeth Marriage, and forbare it. And I
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:8041:43"/>anſwere againe; That what children ſhall bee borne in the World, or what encreaſe of men ſhall ſtore the World, is one of the ſecret things, that I am not to care for, but may enioy the reſt that God allots me, though thereby I forbeare to encreaſe his number: onely if he call mee to marrie, then am I with willingneſſe to ſeeke his honour in that kind of life. Wherefore againe and againe, let Virgins remember <hi>Paul,</hi> and keep them where they be; where they haue no curſt or vnkind husbands, or wiues; no ſicke or ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne children; no ſlothfull or froward ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants; no needs and cares of eſtate to afflict them. And this is the counſell we giue to them that can receiue it. But if any for all this, find his need and deſire ſuch, that he muſt, and will mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: good leaue let him haue from vs, and good ſpeede from God alone; ſo that he take the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing inſtructions with him, which are two.</p>

They ſay, the beginning of a buſineſſe being well performed, is as good as one halfe thereof; and the moſt important
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:8041:43"/>matter in buildings, is to lay a good foundation. Doubtleſſe it is ſo in this matter of marriage, whereinto he that makes a godly, and wiſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, ſhall find his proceeding to bee much more eaſefull and comfortable, then any after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care could make it, without this firſt care. Now in ſetting about marriage, wiſdome and pietie both, command theſe two principall things: firſt, that the younger people, ſonnes and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, doe take the counſell and conſent of their Parents and Gouernours. Secondly, that they labour to make a due choyce of their yoke-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt, Gods bleſſing is largely and firmely promiſed vnto thoſe children, that doe honour their Parents; but his curſe muſt needs follow them (by the law of contraries) that ſhall diſhonour them. If therefore a man, in the very Preface, as it were, to his Marriage, ſhall thruſt the bleſſing of God from him, in refuſing to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and ſhall pull the curſe of God vpon him, in diſhonouring his Parents (the chiefe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his beeing, vnder God, the conduit Pipes, by which God hath deriued all the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of Nature vnto him, and to whom he ſtands moſt deepely, and vnrequiteably ingaged, by the receiuing before-hand, of many and great comforts and good turnes;) how is it poſſible, but that he muſt create a world of miſchiefe to himſelfe? He goes to marrie without, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Gods liking, that goes to marrie without, and againſt the liking of his Parents, onely ſo,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:8041:44"/>that his Parents doe not abuſe their power ouer him againſt the will of God. For it is abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plaine by the Scriptures, that God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his power, of giuing a daughter to a ſon, or taking a daughter for a ſonne, vnto the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of that ſonne or daughter, ſaying to the Parents of Iſrael; <hi>Thou ſhalt giue, or not giue thy daughter; thou ſhalt take, or not take a daughter to thy ſonne.</hi> Wherefore a childs dutie in this caſe, is not to ſuffer his, or her affections to be wedded vnto any perſon, before the Parent haue ſhewed his good liking; or if any affection to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſon ſhall ariſe in them, then to doe as <hi>Samſon</hi> did, goe vnto the Parent, and requeſt their conſent, and helpe. Yea, euen the ſonne of <hi>Hamar,</hi> an Heathen, had learnt this leſſon, and cauſed his father to be his ſpokeſ-man to <hi>Iacob</hi> for <hi>Dinah.</hi> Yea, that child that ſhall find a need of marriage, ought not to conceale his need from his Parents, no more then fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, whoſe deputie the Parent is in that behalfe, but to craue of God firſt, and then of the Parent, to prouide a remedie for his diſeaſe. Religion and Diſcretion, Nature and Grace, doe all concurre, in requiring of children this dutie, and preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing this rule vnto them in marrying. If croſſes come, whither muſt the afflicted perſon run for comfort, but to Parents and friends? Which, how can he doe, if he haue refuſed their directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in marrying? When ſorrowes pinch, what eaſe is there, but in crauing helpe of God? which how can one doe, without a ſting to his ſoule, if
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:8041:44"/>in entring vpon that ſtate, he haue neglected the commandements of God? So he ſhuts vp Heauen and Earth againſt himſelfe, that wrongs his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Heauen, and father in Earth, by a raſh and prepoſterous ruſhing into Matrimonie, &amp; leaues himſelf no harbor to enter into, againſt a ſtorme ariſe. Be wiſe therefore, and be godly, yee chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; let iudgement rule you, and not paſſion; neither giue your affections, nor your ſelues, nor follow your paſſions in beſtowing your ſelues, but with the priuitie and good allowance of thoſe, from whom you had your ſelues. Not one marriage in an hundred hath thriuen well, that was not ordered according to this rule; an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror (ſuch ſo groſſe an error) in the beginning of an action (and ſuch an important action) can hardly, or not at all, be corrected afterwards.</p>
                     <p>But, ſecondly, a fit perſon muſt bee choſen with whom to couple ones ſelfe. Though all the griefes of marriage come not from the vices and diſorders of the yoke-fellowes, yet the moſt grieuous, and moſt bitter of them doe. To haue a fit yoke-fellow, will preuent many matrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all troubles, and will make all eaſier. Now in a yoke-fellow, the maine matter to be deſired, is vertue and godlineſſe; and hee that in chuſing, vouchſafeth that the firſt place, ſhall ſurely bee bleſſed in his choyce: but whoſoeuer ſetteth other, and baſer things before that, doth deale prepoſterouſly and fooliſhly, and ſetting the Cart before the Horſe (as the Prouerbe hath it) can neuer driue comfortably forward in the way
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:8041:45"/>that he would goe. A vertuous, godly perſon, will allow no ſinne, will hearken to counſell, will receiue admonitions and reproofes. In a word, ſuch an one hath no incorrigible fault, all his diſeaſes bee curable. But a wicked and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly perſon hath a deafe eare, a wilfull heart, an incurable ſoule; nothing wil make him mend his faults. The curſe of God purſues the wicked man, how can any thing, but cumber, and attend ſuch a perſon into the family? Who would therefore admit ſuch a companion, though la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with precious Pearles, or painted with the faireſt painting in the World? Beautie is but painting, age and ſickneſſe will weare it away, why ſhould any man make that his guide in chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a wife? No ſouldier would chuſe a leaden ſword, becauſe the ſcabberd is Veluet, and the hilt guilded. A faire countenance will no more helpe to the happineſſe of a married couple, if grace and vertue be away, then a fine Haft will make a knife cut well, if it bee of euill metall. Wherefore follow not the eye, the moſt fickle and fond of al ſences, in a matter of ſo great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, as the choyce of a wife or husband. And ſurely for wealth, what is it but luggage? If wiſdome and vertue bee abſent, it burdens, and doth not comfort? Better a man without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, then money without a man; could the Heathen ſay. Should Chriſtians be leſſe iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? Let not couetouſneſſe conduct thee into marriage: It is a blind vice, and will ſurely leade the man into the pit, that will winke and follow
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:8041:45"/>it. A vertuous woman is aboue Pearles. <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſaid ſo, that knew the worth of all Pearles. A vertuous man muſt needs be as worthie as a vertuous woman. The holineſſe and good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of a companion, are ten times more auaileable for the comfort of thoſe, with whom he muſt conuerſe, then the colour of his skin, or ſtuffing of his purſe. He or ſhe ſhal liue worſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> poorely, that liueth with a rich <hi>Nabal.</hi> Parents, deſtroy not your children, by matching them to miſerable riches. Young men and women, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy not your ſelues, by ſeeking a good outſide, but let both parents and children iudge, as God iudgeth, and follow his counſell, that ſaith, Not the rich, not the faire, but, The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour. He takes the beſt courſe, to gaine content in marriage, that chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not the fineſt body, the ſweeteſt face, the greateſt ſtate, the largeſt portion, but the holieſt heart, the richeſt ſoule, the beautifulleſt ſpirit, and the moſt vertuous man or woman. This is the foundation of welfare in marriage; lay this at firſt, thou canſt neuer elſe reare vp a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble building. Secondly, in other things (if with the former it may bee), an equall yoke-fellow would be taken, of due proportion in ſtate, birth, age, education, and the like, not much vnder, not much ouer, but fit and correſpondent. Thoſe matches doe ſeldome proue but vncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, where this rule is not obſerued. The rich and noble will likely deſpiſe, or ſet light by the poorer and meaner: ſo will younger doe the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:8041:46"/>aged; and there is nothing but miſerie in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, if the yoke-fellowes neglect one another. <hi>Dauid</hi> was hardly drawne to be a Kings ſonne in Law, being himſelfe a meane man in Iſrael. His wiſdome made him not haſtie to ouer-preferre himſelfe. Diſproportioned marriages are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome made, but out of ſiniſter and corrupt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and ſuch intentions doe neuer, almoſt, faile, to bring wretchedneſſe to ſuch, as are led by them. God himſelfe hath ſet vs the beſt coppie of marriage that can be: he made <hi>Euah</hi> meete for <hi>Adam;</hi> ſhee anſwered him, and hee her in age, birth, and all things: hee ſhall ſpeed beſt, that followes neereſt, this firſt preſident of Matrimonie. Wee cannot haue a wiſer coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour, then the Author of all wiſdome; and he is ſurely deceiued, that thinkes to doe better then God. Take therefore a yoke-fellow meet for thee; for the agreement of the married folk, is the beſt helpe againſt all troubles, and this is the ſureſt way to procure agreement. And ſo you haue heard the firſt inſtruction, concerning a diſcreet entrance to preuent trouble.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond follows, and that is as neceſſarie, euen to expect trouble, and prepare for it. When God foretels any thing, wee ſhould make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it. Future things are knowne to him that diſpoſeth all things; wherefore it is folly to flatter ones ſelfe with hopes, contrarie to his predictions. Expectation of an enemie, is halfe an arming; but ſuddenneſſe addes terribleneſſe vnto a croſſe, and makes it inſupportable. Say
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:8041:46"/>then to, and within thy ſelfe: I find that God doth leade to marriage, and I will follow him; but he forewarnes me alſo, of what I ſhall find in marriage, and I will beleeue him. I know I ſhall haue more trouble, then before I had; but by Gods helpe I will beare it with all quietneſſe. And, Lord, ſeeing this world is a world of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and all eſtates are full of briers; now that thou haſt called me to Matrimonie, giue (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee) a willing and able mind, to brooke well the aduerſities of Matrimonie. Moſt folks runne into marriage, as boyes into a crowd, to fee ſome ſport, neuer forethinking how trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome it is to ſtand in a throng; and when they be almoſt preſſed to death by the preſſe of people, then doe they crie out, and would faine get out, if they knew which way. Oh (ſaith one) if I had knowne before, that I ſhould haue met with ſuch a deale of ſorrow, I would neuer haue married! Why, thou improuident foole: How was it that thou kneweſt not that before? This Scripture was not kept from thee, was it? The Apoſtle ſpeaketh plainely enough; thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt haue read, or heard it, if thou wouldeſt thy ſelfe, <hi>Such ſhall haue trouble in the fleſh.</hi> Didſt thou neuer reade this Scripture? or neuer marke it? or neuer beleeue it? If thou readdeſt it not, it was thy profaneneſſe; if thou markedſt it not, it was thine heedleſneſſe; if thou didſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it, it was thine infidelitie: euerie way it was thy folly, not to know before, what God had told thee before, that marriage would bee
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:8041:47"/>more full of afflictions, then ſingle life. Now you that are to marrie, ruſh not thus headlongly into Marriage, that you may not afterwards make booteleſſe complaints againſt it. Feed not your ſelues with windie hopes (this feeding will breed no ſtrength;) I hope mine husband will proue a very kind man; my wife a very dutifull wife; I hope I ſhall not breed and beare with ſo much paine and griefe, as ſuch, and ſuch; I hope I ſhall not haue ſuch weakely and ſickly children, and ſo forth. Fond body! Where bee the grounds of thine hopes? Vpon what props are they built? To hope without ground, is to play the merrie foole. No, it is better, as the Prouerbe hath it, to feare the worſt, that the beſt may ſaue it ſelfe, and to arme vp thy ſelfe in this wiſe: Like enough I ſhall haue as many croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as ſuch, and ſuch: But what if I haue? I doe not runne raſhly vpon them, God leades me, my Parents guide me, I follow ſure directors, God will alſo ſtrengthen mee; and by his mighty helpe, I will goe chearefully vnder theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: for why ſhould not I be ſubiect to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees &amp; ſtatutes of the King of this world? If he will ſend trouble, ſhall I murmur? Shall I faint? No, I will not, but ſue to him for ſtrength, and ſtay vpon him for helpe, and comfort my ſelfe in him, in all theſe cumbers. Thinke of trouble, looke for trouble, reſolue to bee quiet vnder troubles, and pray for ſtrength to bee ſo; and then marrie if thou ſee good; then ſhall thy troubles exerciſe and encreaſe thy patience and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:8041:47"/>other graces, not corrupt and ouerthrow them, as elſe they will.</p>

If thou walke in Gods wayes, he hath vndertaken to make all you do, proſperous. Lo, a ſure way of attaining as much happineſſe, as this lower world can yeeld. For why doth God ſend troubles, but to correct ſin, and to redreſſe diſorders, and to draw men to godlines? If they follow godlines of their owne accord, by hearkning to the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel of his Word, fewer afflictions will be needfull, and fewer ſhal be ſent: for he corrects not willingly, but as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents giue bitter draughts to their children, euen for the health &amp; profit of their children. But ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the man &amp; wife that would liue cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, muſt loue each other tenderly and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. Much, heartie, and holy loue to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will ſweeten all croſſes, and keepe out the worſt and greateſt croſſes. Let the husband loue his wife, as <hi>Paul</hi> enioyneth, and let wiues be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of their husbands, as the ſame Apoſtle pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth, charity wil couer al things, and hope al things, &amp; beleeue all things, and ſuffer all things, and ſo wil mend very many things, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> elſe would ſurely go amiſſe. Wherefore ſtriue more to ſtore thine heart with loue to thine yoke-fellow, then to fill thy coffers with gold and ſiluer: for grace is more auaileable to felicity then wealth; and charitie is the King of graces. And that you may loue each other in large quantity, and after a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall manner, pray often each with other, and each for other, &amp; that will breed much loue. Do much good to the ſoules of each other, and you
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:8041:49"/>ſhall not chuſe, but be kindly affectioned one to another. Thirdly, inſtruct your children and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants in the feare and knowledge of God, labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to make them Gods children and ſeruants, and then they will proue to you good children and ſeruants; or if they proue otherwiſe, the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of your conſciences, that your diligence hath not been wanting to make them ſuch, will comfort you much in their badneſſe. Dutifulnes and obedience to God, wil come attended with dutifulnes and obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to you: care of pleaſing God, will breed care of pleaſing you: a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience towards their chief Gouernor, wil beget a good carriage to you their inferior gouernors. If pietie dwell in your hearts and houſes, it will chaſe the greateſt troubles out of dores, &amp; keep the reſt from breeding much vexation. And if you ſeek to plant and water it in your families, it will likely grow there; or if it ſhould not, yet the doing of dutie wil comfort the hart, though ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe be wanting to endeauour. Laſtly, for your eſtates, let your harts be moderate, &amp; your hands diligent. Labour about the things of the world, elſe an idle perſon muſt walke vpon an hedge of thornes. Loue not the things of the world, elſe a perſon greedy of gaine, ſhall trouble his owne houſe. The diligent hand will bring ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and the moderate heart will bring content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and then the troubles of a mans eſtate muſt needs be made few and eaſie.

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:8041:50"/>and either ſhall not be croſſed, or ſhall not be vexed by croſſes. So haue we ſhewed you, as good directions as we could, to keepe afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous out of doores. But no care will altogether ſhame them. You muſt therefore ſet your ſelues in the ſecond place, to beare them patiently, and not to faint vnder them, nor to be diſtempered by them. Neuer vnwiſh marriage for the cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of marriage. Had-I-wiſt, is ſeemely in no mans mouth. O that I had neuer married, is a moſt vndecent thought in an husbands hart, &amp; a fond word in his lips! Why ſhould our wils op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Gods will, when he hath made it knowne vnto vs? <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith before; <hi>Art thou joyned to a wife? ſeeke not to be looſed.</hi> A valiant ſouldier doth neuer repent of the battaile, becauſe he meetes with ſtrong enemies; he reſolues to be conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and then the more and ſtronger his foes, the greater his honour. So muſt the husband and wife reſolue to conquer the troubles of marriage, and vſe the buckler of patience againſt the blowes of aduerſitie, that they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer. But here alſo you will aske how? and I muſt tell you how. The meanes to get patience in the cumbers of the wedded eſtate, are chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe: firſt, to reſolue, you muſt and will bee patient: ſecondly, to pray that you may bee pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient: thirdly, to conſider your comforts, as well as your croſſes: and fourthly, to looke vp to God, as the Author, and Heauen, as the end of your troubles. A firme purpoſe of will to doe, or ſuffer any thing, doth greatly fortifie the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:8041:50"/>ſoule. Hee that often thinkes, I am bound to beare my part of trouble quietly, ſeeing euery man aliue hath his portion in troubles; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we haue brought troubles vpon our ſelues; and ſeeing theſe troubles are but ſhort and light in compariſon of thoſe we haue deſerued; and therefore I wil euen buckle my ſhoulders to the burden, and not giue way to ſhrinking; this man ſhall find, that an hard loade will lye lighter vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a reſolute heart, then an eaſier burden, vpon an irreſolute ſpirit. Whatſoeuer a Chriſtian man doth conſtantly tell himſelfe, that hee hath great reaſon to doe, ſhall haue much good by doing, and muſt needs doe, or doe worſe; and therfore inacts this ſtatute in his mind, By Gods helpe I will doe it; that ſhall he be able to doe in good meaſure, and God will paſſe by his fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. Doe thus much for the matter of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, inure your minds to thinke much of the reaſons that ſhould induce you to it, and vpon thoſe reaſons to conclude, that through the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious aſſiſtance of God, you will be patient, and you ſhall be ſo. But reſolutions without prayer are preſumptuous, and God doth vſe to chaſtice preſumption, by making it find its owne weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Wherefore you muſt pray much and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as well as reſolue. Strong reſolutions, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſtrong ſupplications, cannot bee in vaine. Lord, muſt thou ſay, by nature I am im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient, apt to fume and fret, or elſe to faint and quaile: but, O, let me be ſtrengthened with all might, according to thy glorious power, vnto
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:8041:51"/>all long-ſuffering and patience with ioyfulneſſe. Lord, ſtrengthen me againſt all infirme and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent fallings of heart, againſt all furious and violent riſings of ſpirit: and ſeeing thou haſt brought me into marriage, inable mee to beare the burdens of marriage. The frequent renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch acknowledgements of our owne feebleneſſe, and petitions to be fortified by the might of Gods Spirit, will cauſe, that wee ſhall find the grace of God to be ſufficient for vs in the bearing of trouble, as well as in the reſiſting of temptation. But thirdly, taſte of the ſweete, as well as of the ſowre of thine eſtate. Call to mind what contents and benefits thine eſtate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth, as well as what calamities. Doubtleſſe, brethren, the comforts of marriage are very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable. Many benefits are found in this eſtate, that are wanting in the other. We muſt reckon as well our gaines as loſſes, as well our profit as paines, and this wil helpe to make the loſſes and labour to ſeeme little. <hi>Iob</hi> ſaid, <hi>Shall we receiue good at Gods hand, and not euill?</hi> Loe, the ſpeedie remembrance of what proſperitie hee had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed, inabled him to be quiet in his preſent tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation: ſo muſt the married perſons doe in their eſtate, for <hi>Iob</hi> is our preſident for patience. Thine yoke-fellow is often froward, but is hee not kind ſometimes? Some children die, or are ſick; are not ſome &amp; more aliue and healthie? ſo in the reſt. Wrong not God &amp; thy ſelf ſo much, as to forget what good he hath done for thee; or if haply the contents of Marriage will not (as
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:8041:51"/>thinke in moſt they will not) anſwere the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; yet referre thy thoughts (for I ſpeake to men that feare God) to thoſe ſpirituall and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall priuiledges that thou doeſt now in part, and ſhalt hereafter more largely enioy. Looke to thy Father, chaſtiſing thee in this world, but ready to crowne thee in the other world. I haue a bad wife or husband, but a good God, and a rich inheritance in Heauen. My children bee naught, but God hath made me his child. My ſeruants euill, but my ſelfe admitted into Gods ſeruice. My ſtate low and penurious here, but my ſinnes pardoned, and a moſt glorious, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and happie eſtate laid vp for me hereafter. The Lord that now doth exerciſe mee with theſe trials, will afford mee ſo much the more glorie in Heauen, by how much I haue more trouble in earth; and ſhall I not manfully, and chearefully beare that affliction, which will adde to mine heauenly bliſſe? Not onely trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles ſuffered for righteouſneſſe ſake, doe make the Crowne of glorie more bright and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but all troubles patiently ſuffered, are the ſeede of great rewards to come. <hi>Iob</hi> did not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer perſecutions for righteouſneſſe ſake, yet his miſeries haue wonderfully augmented his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe. Not onely, though principally, are they bleſſed that ſuffer for Religion and well-doing, but if we ſuffer patiently for Gods ſake, bleſſed are we in theſe ſuffrings, what-euer be the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of them. Loe, now I haue taught you how to be patient in the aduerſities of Matrimony. I
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:8041:52"/>haue one word more to ſay vnto you, and ſo an end. Theſe whom God hath pleaſed ſo to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper in Matrimonie, as that their troubles haue been but very few and light, in compariſon of the generall caſe of men in this reſpect, muſt bee earneſtly admoniſhed, to be heartily and often thankefull. Benefits loſe their chiefeſt fruit, if they come not into our hearts and mouthes, as matter of prayſe. A greater outward bleſſing, then a peacefull and proſperous liuing in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, what thinke you, can God giue vnto a man or woman? Let not this goodneſſe bee ſleighted, if God haue vouchſafed it to any of you. We crie out for anguiſh, if we be croſſed; Why doe we not alſo ſhoute forth into prayſes and thankes, when wee are comforted? If God haue giuen thee a vertuous yoke-fellow, in whom there are few vices, and thoſe ſo ſoundly mortified, that they breake forth but little to thy griefe: wilt thou not giue thankes for this? What would he that hath a ſhrew, a waſte-good, an harlot, giue to haue a wife of ſuch conditions as thine? What would ſhe that hath an vnthrift, a tyrant, a whoremonger, part with, for an huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of thine husbands qualities? Thinkeſt thou that little worth, which another that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, would prize at ſo high a rate? O, let vs not forfeit Gods benefits, or the comfort of Gods benefits, for want of eſteeming, for want of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I haue inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced in caſe of huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands &amp; wiues; enlarge you your own thoughts to children, ſeruants, eſtates, and all other like
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:8041:52"/>particulars, and when you ſee that in any, or all of theſe, the Lord hath ſpared you from much of that anguiſh, which matrimony hath laden others withall, then breake forth into his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſay: Lord, the moſt that will marrie, do meete with much cumber in marriage; but ſuch hath been thy goodneſſe to me, that this yoke hath been very eaſie to mee, and my comforts haue been as great, my croſſes as few, as I could well expect in marriage: O, therefore make me more obedient to thee then others, becauſe thou haſt made my Matrimonie more eaſefull to me then many others. True thankfulneſſe muſt be rooted in the heart, and bloſſome in the tongue, and fructifie in the actions.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Reader: to deale plainely with thee, I was long afraid and aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to put pen to paper, about this theame of Mortification. Not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the point is not exceeding ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to be handled; but becauſe I found my ſelfe verie vnworthie and vnfit to entreate of it. Being guiltie to my ſelfe, of being farre from hauing done any thing worth the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, in the practice of the dutie, I thought it ſcarce likely, that I ſhould doe any great good in writing of it, and I was euen aſhamed to publiſh any thing of mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, finding my ſelfe, alas, ſo little mortified. At laſt yet, I reſolued to aduenture on this worke for two reaſons: One, becauſe I am priuie to my ſelfe, of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing indeauoured (in ſome poore degree, and with ſome truth,) to performe my ſelfe, what here I have taught, and that alſo, not without ſome little ſucceſſe, tho farre ſhort of what I ought, and (but for mine owne careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) might haue attained. Another, becauſe I con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiued, that as a man, which hauing but a ſmall ſtocke, can himſelfe make but ſmall gaines of its returne, may yet giue husband like directions to him that hath a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſtocke, by which he may improue his ten talents to more aduantage, then elſe he could doe: ſo a man, that hauing but a ſmall quantity of grace, can doe little him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<pb facs="tcp:8041:56"/>may yet giue ſound directions to thoſe that haue receiued a greater meaſure of Grace, to further them much in their ſpirituall thrift. And as he that by ſome diſeaſe or wound, is halfe lame, and can goe but a ſlow pace in the knowne right way, may yet direct others to the right way, and quicken their pace, by calling vpon them; ſo may he, whoſe corruptions ſuffer him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed but ſlowly in the wayes of holineſſe, ſhew that way to others, and hasten them therein. In a word, he may be a good Drummer or Trumpeter in the warre, that hath but a weake body, and feeble lims to fight. Hinder not thy ſelfe therefore, from profiting by this Work, by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the weakeneſſes of him that wrote it; ſtriue thou to run apace in this path, I will either follow after thee, or beare thee company, or, if I can, goe before thee, as faſt as I can. Fight thou valiantly at the ſound of this Trumpet, and I will alſo ſtriue to vſe the hand, aſwell as the mouth; and the Sword, aſwell as the Trumpet.

Now all and each of theſe muſt be purſued with a mortall hatred, and aſſailed with the ſame earneſtneſſe and furie, as wee would doe an enemie in the fields, euen with an intention of ſlaughtering him if we can.

                     <p n="3">3. Firſt, the whole corruption of our euill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">Why Luſts are called, Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</note> is in Scripture compared to a mans body, and called, The body of death; wherefore the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall corruptions are fitly termed <hi>members,</hi> or parts, concurring to the full conſtitution of the whole body. You know, that Nature hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for man, head, ſhoulders, armes, breſt, bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thighes, legs, feete, and the reſt; in the fit and apt ioyning together of which, the beeing of the humane body doth conſiſt.

Nothing in the world is more precious to the vnſanctified and vnregenerate man, then his luſts; he could as eaſily part with the ioynts of his body, as with them, yea, with his whole hart, he would be content to redeeme the libertie of following them, by the loſſe of his eye. Well are they termed members, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe to the carnall man, they are as welbeloued, as his members; and hee will as lothly part with them, and as il ſpare them, as his members; yea, a man already in part ſanctified, finds it as much to doe to wreſtle againſt them (till they be not thorowly maſtered, as it were a member mortified and deadned) as if he were to wound and mangle his owne fleſh, and with the right hand to chop off the left. Laſtly, they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led members, becauſe they doe as it were dwel, and worke in our members, ſhewing their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed force and ſtrength in them, and ſtriuing by
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:8041:58"/>them to breake forth into act, carrying them captiues, as weapons of vnrighteouſneſſe. For example: Fleſhly luſt ſhewes it ſelfe in the eye, in the hand, in the foote, in the tongue, ſtiuing to come to that ſtrength, till it may driue a man to ſpeake, or worke ſomething in the parts of his body, that maketh for the expreſſing, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, pleaſing, ſatisfying of the ſame.

This ariſeth partly from Gods commandement, partly from the great danger that will ſurely befall vs, vpon our neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence herein. We all yeeld, that the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of a ſuperiour, doth tie thoſe that are vnder his authority,<note place="margin">In regard of Gods commandement.</note> and makes that thing need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for them to doe, which before was left to their owne pleaſure and liking.

His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement binds our conſciences, &amp; impoſeth vpon our ſoules, a neceſſitie of doing, what hee commands: ſo nothing can bee thought more needfull, then to doe what God requireth; and we haue ſhewed you before, that God hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and expreſſely required you, to plye this worke. Vnleſſe therefore you will become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely rebellious againſt the manifeſt will of the greateſt Commander that is, or can be; you muſt endure the paines (though a paineful paines it will prooue) of putting your luſts to death. This is none of the things which you may do, if you pleaſe; if not, it is at your libertie; the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not great, if it bee left vndone. Nay, the ſtrongeſt bond in the world doth oblige you to it; the bond of your dutie to God, that made you. We may make vſe of <hi>Pauls</hi> words in this matter; Neceſſitie lyeth vpon you, and wo vnto you if you doe it not; for the commandements that require this dutie, will neuer admit of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.<note place="margin">In regard of the danger that will elſe inſue.</note> But if God did not command it, yet the miſchiefe that will follow, if we be careleſſe of it, will make a wiſe man to perceiue a neceſſitie of doing it. We ſay in our common ſpeech, That we muſt needs doe that, the not-doing whereof will procure vs ſuch inconueniences, as a man of vnderſtanding ſhould not bee willing to hazard himſelfe vnto. Now doubtleſſe, if wee ſet not
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:8041:61"/>forward the worke of mortification with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant care, the miſchiefes that will enſue, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable; for wee haue a whole world of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in vs, which, if wee fight not againſt them continually, will gather ſtrength, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come mightie, to the great diſquietneſſe of our ſoules. He that findeth many diſeaſes growing vpon him, ſaith, He muſt needs take phyſick to cure thoſe diſeaſes: he that hath diuers deadly wounds in his body, thinkes he cannot chuſe but vſe plaiſters to heale thoſe wounds: and wee that haue many corruptions, muſt needs take care to keepe vnder thoſe corruptions. For tho the ſeruants of God, at the time of their regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, doe receiue power ouer their corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet they bee not wholly ride of them. The dominion of ſinne is taken away, at the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our ſoules to, God, the preſence of them is not taken away: they rule no longer in vs, but ſtill they remaine in vs; and that ſo, as, if they be not with daily labour kept vnder, they wil grow violent and head-ſtrong, and goe neere to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their ancient ſoueraigntie, at leaſt, to bring vs into great thraldome, as the remnant of the Canaanites did the Iſraelites, that were ſlack in rooting them out. As therefore they that haue many enemies, muſt fight, ſo muſt we; the caſe ſtanding with vs here, as with ſouldiers in the field, or with combatants in the liſts, that muſt kill or bee killed, at leaſt kill, or bee wounded. For, beſides the aptneſſe of our luſts to gather ſtrength, we haue the diuell alſo (a craftie, and a

Wherefore, if we doe not vſe ſome proportionable care to keepe downe ſinne, it cannot goe well with vs. A King that hath not alone many mutinous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in his Kingdome, but alſo a ſtrong enemy without his Kingdome, readie to take all aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of inuading his dominions, and to draw thoſe Rebels together vnto his partie, for the conquering of his Kingdome, muſt needs bee at the coſt and labour, to maintaine an Armie and Garriſons, to reſiſt ſuch an enemie, and repreſſe ſuch ſeditious perſons. Doubtleſſe, our caſe ſtands in ſuch termes. It is all Satans buſineſſe to make our luſts grow mightie, he cannot hurt vs but by them, and therefore it is his greateſt labour to ſtrengthen them, by all the wayes hee can inuent. What can betide vs then, but much miſerie, if wee bee ſlacke to performe on the contrarie, what in vs lyeth, to infeeble them? Doubtleſſe, thoſe many diſordered paſſions that are in vs, through the manifold deuices of Satan vſed for that purpoſe, will gaine to themſelues a great deale of ſtrength, and from their growth in ſtrength, will doe vs a grat deale of hurt, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we follow the Apoſtles counſell, to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them.</p>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:8041:62"/>euils will ſpring from hence: Firſt, wee ſhall grieue and quench the Spirit of God that is in vs, and cauſe it to withdraw it ſelfe (as it were) and to forbeare thoſe comfortable operations, which it once did worke for our good; in ſo much, that at length, we ſhall haue no feeling of it, and ſcarce be able to diſcerne, whether it bee within vs at all, yea, or no. The fleſh luſts againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh, and theſe two are contrarie one to the other: now the growth of one contrarie, is the diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the other; ſo when the Saints are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to reſiſt the fleſh, they perceiue little or no power of the Spirit in them, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo come to that paſſe, that they bee in a great feare and doubt, whether euer they had the Spirit, becauſe they thinke it is now ſo quite departed from them. If we fight ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully on the ſpirits ſide againſt carnall luſts, then the Spirit of Grace will worke, and ſhew it ſelfe mightie in vs; if we ſit ſtill, and giue the fleſh leaue to haue its way, then the Spirit will leaue vs, and alaſſe, it is wo with vs, when that is cauſed to forſake vs: for then our comfort, our peace, and our very life is gone.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But beſides this (and immediately vpon it) our communion with God will bee interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<note place="margin">Interrupting our communion with God.</note> and that comfortable ſence of his loue (wherewith he was ſomtimes pleaſed to cheere vp, and reuiue our hearts,) will bee taken away from vs. It is ſinne alone, that can make a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration betwixt God and vs, and (as a very make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate)
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:8041:63"/>ſets vs againſt him, and him againſt vs. So long as we continue, to vſe ſome good meaſure of care, to quell our wicked luſts, the Lord doth giue himſelfe (as it were) to be ſeene and felt of vs; our ſoules enioy him, and doe taſte the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable ſweeteneſſe of his grace, reſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly aſſured of his loue, and ſatisfied in it; and finding him euer and anon, ſending meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of kindneſſe vnto our ſoules, as a Generall that comes amongſt his ſouldiers, when they fight valiantly, and hartens them vp with his preſence and his ſpeech: but if the Lord find vs dealing falſely, and treacherouſly with him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring parley (as it were) with that Enemie, that he doth irreconcileably hate, and deteſt, and ready to make a truce with that foe, with whom hee would haue no truce taken, no, not for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; then doth he ceaſe to ſpeake friendly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs (as there is great cauſe) and begins euen to chide, and reproue, and threaten, and ſend vs ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of great diſpleaſure. And ah, what ſoule can conceiue a more grieuous loſſe in this world, then the loſſe of the light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance?</p>
                     <p n="6">6.<note place="margin">Committing of groſſe ſinnes.</note> But ſometimes there followes a farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter miſchiefe, namely, that he which gaue ſinne leaue to get head through careleſneſſe, is at laſt ſo foyled by the wicked luſts of his heart, that he falles to commit ſome groſſe and grieuous ſinnes, very foule, very loathſome, very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefull. For you muſt not thinke, that the man regenerate, is out of the danger of being ouerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:8041:63"/>with hainous offences. Indeed, whileſt hee is earneſt, in beating downe his vnruly paſſions, though he find trouble, yet he enioyes ſafetie; and though his luſts ſtruggle and annoy him, yet they cannot breake forth in extremitie; but if he once become heedleſſe, and thinke it too much, to be at the paines of continually morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying them, then they raiſe vp themſelues, and carrie him captiue, and cauſe him to giue his members as weapons of vnrighteouſneſſe, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing ſo farre at length, that if God himſelfe did not (out of his vnchangeable loue) come in to his reſcue, he would be brought backe againe into Egypt (as it were;) his ſoule would be quite ſlaine, the life of Grace would bee quite extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, and hee would returne the ſecond time to bee dead in ſinnes. And, ah, what wiſe man would ſuffer his ſinnes to become ſo violent, as to carrie him into ſuch enormous deeds, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> and <hi>Aſa,</hi> and <hi>Vzziah,</hi> fell into, and all for want of mortifying theſe members? A man once ſanctified, may aſſure himſelfe vpon his faithfull and conſtant endeauours in mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that he ſhall eſcape ſuch foules: but if he grow ſlacke in this dutie, he can expect nothing, but to haue his conſcience thus wounded. Is it not more then needfull for vs to looke to our ſelues?</p>
                     <p n="7">7. For laſtly,<note place="margin">Sore afflictions.</note> to the preuenting of farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter euils, our not-ſufficiently mortified luſts, will bring vpon vs exceeding ſore afflictions, becauſe the goodneſſe of God is ſuch, that he wil not ſee
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:8041:64"/>vs periſh by them, as we ſhould periſh, if he did not apply ſuch coroſiues to cure them. If afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions come not betwixt, neglect of the dutie of mortification will produce the euill effect I laſt named, <hi>viz.</hi> the perpetrating of ſome vile and notorious wickedneſſe; ſometimes the Lord makes haſte to ſtrike vs, for the preuenting of ſuch falles: but if we be once falne, then is there no way of recouerie, but by ſome bitter croſſe, either inward or outward, or moſt times both wayes. So we doe inforce the Lord of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to afflict vs (vnleſſe we would haue him loſe vs quite) when we waxe careleſſe of ſeeking, to preuaile more and more againſt ſinne. A crazie bodie, hauing diſordered himſelfe in diet, muſt needs haue very ſicke fits, and ſome ſicke-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king phyſicke he muſt needs take, or elſe death would follow his intemperancie. So our weake and crazie ſoules, being brought to ſtrange diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers by our folly, in not reſiſting the ſinfull and inordinate diſpoſitions of our ſoules, could neuer be brought again to any tolerable ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, if God did not, by heauie calamities, helpe to purge out thoſe euill humours, which we had ſuffered to peſter vp our ſoules, as we may ſee in <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Aſa,</hi> after their ſinnes. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the farre greater number of croſſes which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall the people of God, doe come from hence, that their heauenly Father is faine (vnleſſe hee would ſee them damned, which he will neuer doe) by miſerie to keepe downe luſts, which they might (but will not, without miſery) keepe
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:8041:64"/>downe, by the careful exerciſe of mortification, and to draw them to repentance for thoſe loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſinnes, which for lacke of mortifying their earthly members, they haue falne into, and would neuer repent of otherwiſe: ſo that if we will not bee content to put our ſelues to the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of working out our ſaluation, by crucifying the fleſh, God will put vs to the paines of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring heauie croſſes, that ſhall helpe to crucifie them (in a manner) whether we will or no.

                     <p n="2">2. The firſt is,<note place="margin">Great peace.</note> vnſpeakeable peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſoule. The heart will be at one with God it ſelfe and all men, ſo long as it holdeth variance with ſinne. Hee that is at warre with
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:8041:65"/>his luſts, ſhall not be at warre with his Maker. If we fight his battailes againſt our corruptions, he will not fight againſt vs. Nothing cauſeth the God of Heauen to frowne vpon man, but ſinne; while the World was free from ſinne, it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo free from all tokens of Gods diſpleaſure; therefore it muſt needs follow, that the ſureſt way to keepe our ſelues in euen termes with God, is to be diligent in reſiſting ſinne. He is not of ſo ill a nature, as to picke quarrels againſt vs without a cauſe; himſelfe tels vs, that he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects not willingly,<note place="margin">Lament. 3.33.</note> nor of his own accord. Sin then, being the ſole cauſe of mouing him againſt vs, wee ſhall bee ſure to find him ſo farre louing towards vs, as wee are carefull to preſerue our ſelues from ſinning againſt him, which is beſt and moſt attained, by the ſtudie of mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſo all will bee well aboue our heads in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, if we follow <hi>Pauls</hi> direction. Now the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is Gods officer and deputie, and that, that will make him gentle and quiet to vs, will make it alſo quiet and gentle. The conſcience neuer ſhould (and ſeldome doth) riſe vp in armes againſt a man, but when he hath giuen leaue to ſome corruption to grow head-ſtrong, for want of oppoſing it in due ſeaſon and order. As there is no diſtempered motion in the body, till the humours be immoderately ſtirred, by ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or outward occaſions; ſo neither is there likely terror, amazement, diſquietment, in the conſcience, till the luſts of the ſoule haue diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it, for want of holding them vnder. so
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:8041:65"/>that as warre abroad, is found to be a preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, againſt ciuill diſſentions of ſubiects; ſo warre with ſinne, is the cauſe of our tranquillitie with our ſelues. When clouds are diſpelled, the beames of the Sunne will ſhine comfortably vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, and then the earth is richly gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with pleaſant and profitable herbes; ſo when ſinne is chaſed away, the warme beames of Gods fauour doe ſweetely refreſh the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the conſcience ſo refreſhed, doth bring forth the ſweet and wholeſome flowres of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable conſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The Spirit of God wil tell our ſpirits, and our ſpirits will tell vs, that God is our Friend and Father, that he loues vs, and delights in vs, ſo long as we be haue our ſelues to ſinne, as to an enemy, hating, loathing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting it. Thus are we moſt friends to our ſelues, when wee bee moſt foes with our corruptions. And this fighting with ſinne, will make vs liue quietly alſo with our neighbours. Hee that is buſie in finding out, and ſubduing his home-bred corruptions, ſhall haue little or no leaſure, to take cauſeleſſe vnkindneſſes, to picke needleſſe quarrels, and to prouoke others againſt him by iniurious behauiour; ſo ſhall hee ſhun the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt company of iarres and brawles, that vſe to ſet men together by the eares. Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith;<note place="margin">Iames 4.1.</note> That warres and fightings amongſt men doe come from their luſts, which war in their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. We may, if we will, deceiue our ſelues, and attribute things to falſe cauſes; but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, that vnderſtandeth all things aright,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:8041:66"/>and cannot be deceiued, points to luſt, fighting in the members, as the moſt true, proper, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate cauſe of contentions &amp; ſtirres betwixt man and man. Therefore the more any man doth quell, ſubdue, vanquiſh, weaken, and beate downe theſe luſts, the more calmely ſhal he paſſe thorow the ſea of the world, and the fewer ſtormes of diſcord. and enmitie, ſhall hee meete withall. When ſouldiers lye idle, and are not imployed in marching againſt the common foe, then they mutinie, and fall out with each other: ſo when men ſet not their griefe and hatred, and other affections ou worke, to make war vpon ſin, then they quickly take occaſion to grieue at each other, to ſigh one againſt another, to hate one another, and to vexe and gawle each other, and trouble themſelues moſt of all. But ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers agree among themſelues, whileſt they lend their powers againſt a common foe; ſo when we haue ſtrongeſt and hotteſt warre with the deuill and ſinne, then doe we nouriſh moſt concord with one another. Thus ſhall the ſoule enioy vnutterable quietneſſe euery way within and without, from God, and from man, and one weekes life, led in ſuch comfortable and happie concord and amitie with a mans owne ſoule, and all about him, is more worth, then the laſting of a whole twelue-moneth, torne and rent aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with the ciuill broyles and commotions of a grudging, froward, and diſtempered heart.

What was the cauſe that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo exceeding quiet and ioyfull in all his calamities? but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had in great meaſure ſubdued, and was more and more buſie in ſubduing the corrupt luſts of his body, knocking it downe,<note place="margin">1.

Hee that holdeth ſtrong fight againſt the euils of his owne heart (out of that peace with God and his owne ſoule, which we ſaid before that he ſhould enioy) hath freedome of Spirit, to pray vnto God in his afflictions; hee can runne boldly to the Throne of grace (as hauing allowed nothing within him, that ſhould grieue the Spirit of Grace) hee can flie to the towre of Gods name (as hauing kept himſelfe in the pathes of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, whic thoſe that do, know themſelues to haue all good allowance, to come thither) and when a man can freely powre forth his hart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in croſſes, then doth he alſo comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably enioy God, and then the ſharpenes of the croſſe is gone. The thing that makes croſſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerably bitter (ſo that the ſoule cannot endure
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:8041:67"/>the bitterneſſe of them) is the admixture of the gawle of Gods diſpleaſure; ſo farre as wee are intire and reſolute in fighting againſt ſinne, our croſſes are pure from this admixture, and ſo they be not (to himſelfe that beares them, howſoeuer they may ſeeme to the lookers on) by the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth part ſo tedious and troubleſome, as that compoſition would make them. So the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied man gaines this by his trouble in mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Lord will ſuffer him to eſcape ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny troubles, and thoſe that he muſt (for his owne good) ſuffer, he ſhall be able to goe vnder with ten times more quietneſſe, and gladneſſe, and contentedneſſe; as an whole ſhoulder beares the ſame burden with more eaſe, then a ſore, or ſwolne ſhoulder. It is therefore a very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble labour that wee beſtow in mortifying the members on earth; that is to ſay, in healing the ſores and diſeaſes of our ſoules.</p>

Wee are neuer ouertaken with thoſe kind of euils, but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our very palpable careleſneſſe of mortifying the deeds of our fleſh. Whileſt we do that, that

Laſtly,<note place="margin">Good eſteeme from man.</note> much true credit and good eſteeme will follow to the Saints of God, from the work of mortification, both with the houſhold of faith, and with ſtrangers alſo. The mortified man affects the hearts of all that behold him, with admiration, and the leſſe he couets the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of men, the more he wins it. Who is he, that ſeeing a man able to hold downe anger, vniuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, reuenge, luſt, when ſtrong occaſions do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke them to work, doth not find his ſoule clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to him, at once louing and wondring at him? Heathen men, that haue for their credit ſake, ſo farre diſſembled mortification, as, in ſomething a notable faſhion, to forbeare euill doing, haue been more famous for that in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, then for all their wealth and victories: for it is more truly prayſe-worthy to be good, then great; and therefore an high degree of goodnes, will more honour a man in the hearts of men, then the higheſt degree of greatneſſe. The ſoule will not ſtoope to other things, though the knee doe crouch; but the very ſoule of the higheſt perſon that is, will euen bow to the name of a man, that is excellent in mortification. What made <hi>Herod</hi> honour <hi>Iohn Baptist?</hi> but this, that he ſaw him ſo thorowly mortified. Euery man is inforced by his conſcience, to eſteeme wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily of one, whom he ſees doing that, which he knowes himſelfe ſhould doe, but finds hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. Now euery mans ſoule (in a manner euery
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:8041:68"/>mans) is conuinced, that he ſhould conquer am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, reuenge, couetouſneſſe, luſt; and his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience telles him, how little he is able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme in this buſineſſe; wherefore, when he ſees another euer conquering that ſinne, whereto himſelfe is a perpetuall vaſſall, and of which hee is euer conquered, hee ſtrangeth at him, and lookes vpon him, as vpon ſome extraordinarie, and miraculous perſon. Indeed ſinners are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times ſo tranſported with the loue of ſinne, that (as Owles hate the light which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not looke vpon, ſo) they nouriſh in themſelues, euen enmitie, againſt theſe excellencies, which they cannot imitate: but then, when they are out of their mad and drunken fits, when they are themſelues, when they know what they do and ſay, as in the day of affliction, of ſickneſſe, of death, they cannot but ſhew themſelues, to beare more heartie reuerence, and vnfained reſpect to him, whom they haue ſeene carefull and able to mortifie the deedes of the body, then to all the rich and mightie men on earth. Brethren, you might well ſaue the coſt of hanging your backs, with ouer-gorgious attire, and making ſo much adoe, to trim vp your bodies; the carefull figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt ſin, and preuailing againſt it (which will follow fighting) would doe you more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie amongſt all your neighbours, then all the fine cloathes vnder heauen. If thou couldeſt thruſt thy ſelfe into a garment, made all of gold and Diamonds, and come garniſhed alſo King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, with a Crowne and Scepter, the hearts of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:8041:69"/>men would not entertaine thee with ſo much eſteeme, as if they ſee thee (as it were god-like) in ouercomming the ſinnes, that ouercome the greateſt of the ſonnes of men. A good name is a precious oyntment, and a precious iewell, which nothing will get ſo ſoone, or ſo ſurely, as goodneſſe. Wherefore fight againſt ſinne, that thou mayeſt haue honour in the conſciences of men, and ſome kind of authoritie and command in them (as I may ſay) by vertue of this honour.</p>

Pay will make any ſouldiers fight: If Chriſts ſouldiers will but ſticke to it couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, they ſhall want no pay of comfort, glorie, immortalitie; and if they fight, they ſhall bee crowned. When <hi>Caleb</hi> fought againſt Debir, he

                        <hi>To him that ſmiteth, and taketh the Citie, will I giue</hi> Achſah <hi>my daughter to wife:</hi> and quickly <hi>Othniel</hi> was incouraged, and tooke it. Now how much more excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t are the promiſes which the Lord hath made, to encourage vs in this ſpirituall bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, ſaying? <hi>If you mortifie the deeds of the fleſh by the Spirit, yee ſhall liue?</hi> What wife, or what portion with a wife, is comparable to this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and glorious life, which God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and will giue to thoſe, that take their luſts and ſmite them? Why then ſhould we not ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate our ſelues, and doe valiantly, to take and kill theſe ſpirituall Canaanites, and to deſtroy all the Cities of them? If any ſay, This promiſe is made alone to thoſe that ouercome, and how ſhall we be certaine of victorie? The anſwere is, that it is true indeed, thoſe alone that ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, ſhall obtaine this reward; but euery one that will fight reſolutely in this battaile, ſhall ouercome. And that is the laſt incouragement, in reſpect of our ſucceſſe; as wee ſhall loſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and be accepted, and be rewarded; ſo wee ſhall preuaile alſo, and get the better of our foes.</p>

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:8041:74"/>Through God wee ſhall doe valiantly, and hee will tread downe our enemies vnder our feete. When Iſrael fought againſt the inhabitants of Canaan, the Lord fought for them; and though their enemies were ſtrong in body, and many in number, and had Cities fenced and walled vp to heauen, yet they proſpered whitherſoeuer they went, and none was able to ſtand againſt them. This was a figure of our good ſucceſſe in fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the luſts of our fleſh. They cannot eſcape our hands, if we giue them not leaue to recouer themſelues. So mightie is the Word of God, ſo ſtrong the Spirit of God, ſo certaine the diuine aſſiſtance, that wee are ſure of an happy victorie, if wee cloathe our ſelues with courage and confidence, and perſiſt in the battaile to the end of our liues. The Lord that fought for Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, will fight for vs, and worke great ſaluation. The land of Canaan was inhabited with Giants, and men of huge ſtature, but all theſe fell before the Hoſt of God; our Giant-like ſinnes ſhall bee but meate for our ſwords, and we ſhall preuaile againſt them, though they be neuer ſo many and ſtrong.

It is plaine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, you ſee, that hee which is a worker of wickedneſſe, and doth giue himſelfe leaue to goe on in the common practice of theſe abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable euils, is not tranſlated from darkeneſſe to light, he is not made partaker of the vertue of the death of Chriſt, he is not buried with Chriſt by Baptiſme into his death, nor made confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable vnto his death; ſo that it is in vaine to flatter our ſelues with a falſe opinion of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good Chriſtians, ſo long as theſe things do ſo ſtrongly beare rule in vs, hat wee giue our members as ſeruants vnto them ordinarily: for the good man muſt not walke in the counſell of ſinners, nor ſtand in the way of the vngodly.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But ſecondly,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>2.</hi> And the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of the leaſt ſinne.</note> a godly man muſt preuaile yet further againſt ſinne, euen ſo farre, as not to allow, defend, excuſe, extenuate, and careleſly let paſſe the ſmalleſt knowne ſinne, yea the firſt riſings, and motions of ſinne; but muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly obſerue, oppoſe, confeſſe, bewaile, and be humbled for them, before God:<note place="margin">Math. 5.8.</note> for no man can be bleſſed, till hee be pure in heart; and hee that muſt aſcend into the hill of the Lord, and ſtand in his holy place,<note place="margin">Pſal. 24.4.</note> muſt haue (as cleane hands, ſo) a pure heart alſo, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith. Now the heart is not pure, ſo long as any the leaſt ſin is winked at, allowed, maintained, couered and made light of.

It is therefore apparant, that grace muſt ſo farre change vs, and ſubdue our corrupt diſpoſition, as that wee muſt crucifie the fleſh, with the very affections and luſts, or elſe we are not planted with Chriſt into the ſimilitude of his death, nor can truly take to our ſelues the name, or inioy the priuiledges of men that doe mortifie the deeds of the body. And this is the leaſt degree that will ſerue to intitle a man to the comfort of one that is truly mortified.</p>

This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, by the helpe of grace, a godly man may reach to in this life; and O how beautifull and happie a life were it, to goe, euen thus farre, in the ſubduing of ſinne, that one ſhould be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and altogether free from all blemiſhfull and reprochfull ſinnes!

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:8041:76"/>euen to keepe his heart free from any ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled liking of any euill motion thereof,<note place="margin">To be free from any ſettled li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of an ill motion.</note> ſo that he ſhall neuer take any ſtayed or deliberate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in any of the ſinfull inclinations, &amp; diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that doe ſtirre in him.

Now let me ſhew you, by what meanes both theſe degrees muſt be attained, and a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man muſt paſſe forward, from the former, to the latter. The meanes of mortification are of two ſorts, ſome naturall, ſome ſpirituall, and both are requiſite, if wee purpoſe to kill our luſts; the former muſt make the latter more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall, and be helpfull to our good ſucceſſe in them.<note place="margin">Moderation in things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, a meanes of mortifying ſin.</note> The one is, moderation in the vſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall delights and contents. The other, diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the ſhunning of outward occaſions of euill, though the things in themſelues bee not euill.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For the firſt, hee that is not moderate in things indifferent, can neuer preuaile againſt his luſts, to any purpoſe; for at the exceſſe of theſe lawfull things, doe our naturall corruptions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to take aduantage, and to feed themſelues, and to gather head. He that will hold vnder his luſts therefore, and put them to death, muſt bee ſparing in meate, drinke, attire, ſports, and muſt euen cut himſelfe ſhorter in many of theſe things, then that which he perſwadeth himſelfe
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:8041:77"/>(and perhaps alſo truly) that he might lawfully doe, euen of purpoſe to keepe himſelfe, that hee may not bee brought vnder the power of any thing, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh. We muſt learne of the Apoſtle himſelfe this meanes; for he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs, that hee did keepe vnder his body,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.12. 1. Cor. 9. laſt.</note> and bring it in ſubiection. The corruptions of the ſoule finde great furtherance from the humours of the body, as a man doth find from a good and fit toole or inſtrument: we muſt keep the tooles of ſinne dull, (as I may ſo ſpeake) that ſinne it ſelfe may doe vs leſſe harme by its working. If the body be ſtill humored and pampered, by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it haue all the eaſe, fine fare, gay attire, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall pleaſures and paſtimes, that it wiſheth (and that a man can make to appeare lawful and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable,) it will not bee kept in ſubiection, it will not be held in order. We are therefore in theſe thins to call vpon our ſelues, to bee very temperate. Be a little more meane in thy gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then thou thinkeſt it abſolutely needfull to be: vſe a little leſſe liberty in games and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes, then thou conceiueſt that in ſtrictneſſe of conſcience thou oughteſt to doe. So I ſay for fare, eaſe, ſleepe; If thou doſt not, from the vtmoſt confines of lawfull liberty, there is but a ſmall ſtep to the border of vnlawfull delights, and ſoone maiſt thou be drawn to ſtep that ſtep, and when thou haſt once tranſgreſſed, thou ſhalt finde it hard to come into the right way againe. He that goes in a riuer, where he knowes that a deepe pit is, will not come ſo cloſe to it as hee
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:8041:78"/>may, but by keeping himſelfe vpon ſure ground a good way off, will bee ſure to ſaue himſelfe from being ouerwhelmed therein. It is much more ſafe, in things of this nature, to keepe our ſelues a good deale within compaſſe, then to ſtand vpon the edge of our liberty (as I may ſo ſpeake.) By abridging our ſelues of ſome thing that we are allowed, wee cannot likely receiue any hurt: by taking all that is allowed, we may ſoone ſlip into exceſſe, and well-neere miſchiefe our ſelues, and by doing all we may doe, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage our ſelues to our affections, that they will carry vs away, to that wee ſhould not doe. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtereneſſe is not neceſſary to mortification, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration is. To goe wooll-ward, or in haire-cloth, is a fooliſh deſtroying of the body; to go in leſſe coſtly attire then one might, is a due keeping vnder of the body. To make ones ſelfe leane and wanne with faſting, is to tyrannize o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ones ſelfe; to fare leſſe delicately, and eate leſſe liberally, for the moſt part, then one might, is to preuent the aduantages of ſinne in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. The hypocrite, often, doth place all his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, in being cruel to his body; wherfore he keepes no meaſure this way; and becauſe it is a thing much looked after, and eaſily ſeene, it is a fit thing for an hypocrite, to beguile both the world and himſelfe withall. The godly man doth make his abridging of the body, a furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to the cutting off of his luſts: wherefore he is not exceſſiue in his rigour to his body, nor will offer violence to nature, but alone deny
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:8041:78"/>her that, which ſhee may well ſpare, and ſcants and mints himſelfe in the vſe of his liberty, not as not knowing it, but as knowing how eaſie it is to abuſe it, and by abuſing, to take harme. And thus, by keeping his body in order, hee findes it more eaſie to keepe the minde in frame alſo, which doth much make vſe of (and as ſome thinke follow) the temperature of the body. And let any man vnder heauen be ſo wiſe, as to obſerue himſelfe, and he ſhall finde, that vnleſſe he deny himſelfe ſome lawfull liberty, he ſhall quickly grow ſenſuall: and ſenſuality is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to mortification.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A ſecond naturall meanes of mortification is, a careful ſhunning of the occaſions of ſin.<note place="margin">Shunning the occaſions of ſin, neceſſary to mortification.</note> Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of time, place, company, and the like, doth greatly incenſe and prouoke corruption: and he that will not, (for euery man in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe it is but naturall, can if he will) denie himſelfe in ſuch things, can neuer preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his corruptions. He hath not gone yet ſo farre as nature may goe, and how then ſhould he looke to finde the helpe of grace? The with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of a mans ſelfe from theſe things, is a pulling of the fuell from the fire, and then it wil ſurely goe out. The aduenturing vpon theſe things, doth blow the coles, and adminiſter fuell alſo, and then muſt ſinne of neceſſity, both burne and flame. In theſe occaſions, the ſences haue ſtrong allurements offered vnto them, and they be vehement in their workings, burying the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding for a time, and captiuating the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:8041:79"/>thoughts to their preſent pleaſing obiects, ſo that a man can thinke of no good thing, that may ſerue to reſiſt bad deſires; and when the ſoule is ſo diſarmed, how ſhould ſinne but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile againſt it? He that doth thus hazard him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, thruſts himſelfe out of Gods protection, for he walketh not in his owne place, therefore he can looke for nothing but ruine. Satan aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth himſelfe of victorie, when hee ſees men ſo careleſſe of themſelues, and ſo becomes vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in tempting, (as hope of ſucceſſe incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth euery one to labour) and then how ſoone is a man foyled? Indeed, the heart hath giuen a ſecret conſent to the deſire of euill doing, ſo ſoone as euer it conſents to aduenture vpon the occaſions of euill doing, and it is but the very guile and diſſimulation of the ſoule, (whereby it is apt to coozen it ſelfe,) that makes one thinke, I will goe where I ſhall meete with ſtrong pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocations to ſinne, but yet I will not ſinne. Now the conſent which was ſecret, and as it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite before, ſo ſoone as occaſion and tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on haue ſtirred corruption, growes manifeſt and open, and ſhewes it ſelfe, and ſo a man ſins, when he thought (but he thought amiſſe) that he was reſolued not to ſinne. Betwixt a reſolution to doe a thing, whereby the will doth chuſe, and a reſolution not to doe it, whereby the will doth refuſe, there is a middle kind of action, an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluteneſſe, a ſuſpence, neither chuſing, nor refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, but betwixt both. Now this indifferency of the will, is halfe a yea; and hee that makes
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:8041:79"/>halfe a grant, when none importunity doth preſſe him, will make a full and totall grant, when hee ſhall be (as vpon ſuch occaſions hee ſhall bee) importunately vrged: and it is ſure, that a man neuer doth wittingly put himſelfe vpon occaſions of euill, vntill hee bee at leaſt irreſolute whether to doe it or not. Wherefore euery Chriſtian man muſt be wiſe for his ſoule, and not alone determine to forbeare all things that are ſinfull and flatly condemned; but if hee haue found by his owne experience, that ſuch and ſuch things (in themſelues indeed lawfull) are, to his corruption, ſtrong prouocations to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill; hee muſt alſo determine to deny himſelfe in theſe things alſo. In one word, this direction is ſo neceſſary, that all the labour in the world will not ſubdue ſinne, if it bee not backed with this part of circumſpect walking. For if the heart be hollow, nothing will make it ſtrong a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſinne: and euery mans heart is ſo far hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, as he is willing to play with the occaſions of ſinne.</p>

If a man had neuer ſinned, he ſhould need onely petitions and thankeſgiuings; but hauing ſinned, he needs alſo confeſſion and lamentation, to be ioyned with the former, as it were buttreſſes to the wall of the houſe, to make it ſtand ſtronger, and a ſtaffe to a weake leg, to make one goe the more ſtedfaſtly. So all theſe parts of prayer muſt be vſed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We muſt plainly acknowledge, and hartily bemone our ſelues in Gods boſome, for our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and wickedneſſe of heart and life, and with all due aggrauations, and condemnings of our ſelues, muſt lay open before the Lord, the corruptions and vices that we find in our ſelues, confeſſing withal, that we are weake and feeble, and ſlaues to ſinne, and of our ſelues cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due them, and ſo, with the heauieſt hearts that we can, lament our miſerable weakneſſe.

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:8041:80"/>of the Lubims and Ethiopians againſt him and his people; the ſame muſt we doe, when we ſee the innumerable troupes of corrupt luſts, that do ſeeke the deſtruction of our ſoules:<note place="margin">2. Chron. 20.12</note> We haue no might (ſaith that worthy King) againſt this great company that comes againſt vs; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know we what to doe, but our eyes are vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee. So muſt the Chriſtian ſoule ſigh out its complaints before the Lord, often, O I haue no might to ouercome all theſe ſtrong luſts, (and by name ſuch and ſuch) that fight againſt mee daily, and I cannot tell what to doe, but, Lord, mine eyes are to thee.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Then muſt hee take to him petitions and requeſts, begging helpe from heauen, crying earneſtly for the Spirit of God to helpe him, (for by the Spirit alone can wee mortifie the deeds of the body) vrging and inforcing vpon the diuine Maieſty, all his comfortable promiſes which he hath written in his Word:<note place="margin">Rom. 6.14.</note> 
                        <hi>(Sinne ſhall not haue dominion ouer you, for you are not vnder the law, but vnder grace.</hi>

                        <hi>They ſhall all know me, from the leaſt to the moſt, and I will put my law in their hearts, and in their minds will I write them,</hi>) and ſo, ſuing with the greateſt feruency of deſire that he can attaine, ſay, O Lord, performe theſe promiſes: <hi>O let no wickedneſſe haue dominion ouer me: O make me ſound in thy precepts: O incline mine
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:8041:81"/>heart vnto thy teſtimonies,</hi> and not to ſuch a ſinne. When God is thus importuned by the cries and prayers of his ſeruants, hee cannot but ſtirre vp himſelfe, and come and helpe them, and heare the voyce of their prayers when they cry vnto him. When Iſrael felt the oppreſſion of their outward enemies, and cryed vnto the Lord, (as it is often noted in the booke of Iudges) the Lord had pity vpon them, and raiſed them vp a Iudge and a deliuerer: ſhall he not bee much more attentiue to the voyce of their ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when they cry vnto him, againſt pride, vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, luſt, wrath, and thoſe ſpirituall enemies that ſeeke to oppreſſe them? Certainly the Lord will remember, and will vp, and helpe, and ſet them at liberty, whom ſinne and Satan had inſnared.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And to the two former muſt bee added, praiſes and thankes for the helpe already recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. If one finde that hee hath gotten ſome po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer againſt his ſinne, that hee hath more ability to oppoſe the luſts of it, that hee is ſeldomer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertaken with any breaking forth of it then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that he hath been able to withſtand ſome notable tentations to it: in a word, that the force of it, is in any meaſure abated; hee muſt returne with the praiſes of God in his mouth, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in God, that hath helped him ſo farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his ſpirituall foe. The Lord deſerueth praiſe, and lookes for praiſe of his Saints, for treading downe thoſe luſts that riſe againſt them: and it is a ſeruice very pleaſing vnto him,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:8041:81"/>when we offer the facrifice of thankes. Yea, it doth exceedingly animate our ſelues to this battell, if we take notice that wee haue in ſome degree preuailed, and with the voyce of ioy and thankeſgiuing doe runne before the Lord, and giue away all the praiſe from our ſelues to him. There is nothing can more reioyce the ſpirit of a Chriſtian, then this heauenly ioy will doe. The ioy of the Lord is our ſtrength. Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,<note place="margin">Nehem. 8.10.</note> when we haue been foyled, is no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileable to confirme vs againſt ſinne, then holy reioycin, when we haue ſtood faſt and reſiſted. It is a more ſigne of ſelfe-loue, to grieue for that we are weake, but a greater ſigne of true loue to God, to reioyce in him when hee makes vs ſtrong. Wherefore, as a godly man, if hee finde himſelfe any day to haue yeelded to ſinfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires in any ſenſible degree, muſt humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and confeſſe and cry out againſt himſelfe: ſo if he finde that any day he hath not been foy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but hath been able to repreſſe and deſtroy euill motions, eſpecially if hauing occaſion or tentation, he haue beene ſtrengthened to reſiſt, he muſt then leade his captiuity captiue, and at night ſing a new ſong of praiſe vnto the Lord, and euen ride in triumph ouer his corruptions, boaſting himſelfe in God, and ſetting vp his banner in the name of the moſt High, and with as cheerefull a ſoule as he can, offer vp humble and hearty thankes to his heauenly Father, that hath made him to doe valiantly. The prayers of Gods ſeruants, thus conſeſſing their ſinnes, cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:8041:82"/>power againſt them, bleſſing God for the beginnings of helpe, are weapons ſo mighty through God, that they will wound the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt corruption, and pierce the ſoule of any luſt: and whoſoeuer will begin and continue, thus to reſiſt and purſue his ſinnes, ſhall finde them (as the Philiſtims before <hi>Samſon</hi>) to fly, and fall downe dead before him.</p>

In a word, that he is euery way moſt holy, and moſt

                     <p n="2">2. Secondly,<note place="margin">Of Gods terrible threats.</note> we muſt often call to mind the moſt terrible threatnings of God againſt ſinne in generall, and ſpecially, againſt that ſpeciall ſin, which moſt moleſteth vs. Ho much euill God hath denounced againſt the committers of it; and how much woe and miſerie it hath brought vpon others, and will bring vpon our ſelues, if we take licence to liue in it. Wee muſt conſider ſinne in the euill effects of it, and ſo conuince our ſelues of its vileneſſe, and miſchieuouſneſſe: for God hath from Heauen manifeſted ſo much wrath againſt the workers of iniquitie in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and againſt each particular luſt and ſinne that men liue in, that if we could preſſe theſe things vpon our owne ſoules, and cauſe our hearts ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly to beleeue the ſame; wee could not but hate wickedneſſe, and tremble before the Lord, and ſo abate the power of corruption, and euen driue our ſelues out of the euill courſes of ſinne. Wrath and anger, tribulation and anguiſh,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.8, 9.</note> ſhall be vpon euery ſoule of man that worketh wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, vpon the Iew firſt, and alſo vpon the Gentiles.

                     <p n="3">3.<note place="margin">Of Gods graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſes.</note> Thirdly, we muſt ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cal to mind the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſes that God hath made to thoſe that leaue ſin, and the admirable comforts, that both here and hereafter, the God of truth hath vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to reward them withall, that for his ſake denie themſelues, and crucifie their ſinfull luſts. Then ſhall wee ſee, how vaine and friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous the pleaſures and profits of ſinne are, and by taſting the fruit of holineſſe, ſhould bee well inabled, to deſpiſe the offers of ſin. What com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon betwixt the good we get by doing euill, and the vnſpeakeable Ioy of the holy Ghoſt, and the immortal Ioyes of Heauen? What made <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſet light by the honours and delights of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court; but that he conſidered the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke of Chriſt to be greater riches? What made <hi>Paul</hi> to count al dung, that he might win Chriſt;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:8041:83"/>but becauſe hee looked to the farre moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent waight of glorie? Wee muſt not ſuffer our ſelues to be forgetfull of the wonderfull bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, which the Lord will beſtow vpon vs, if in obedience and loue to him, wee can be content to caſt away our ſinfull luſts. He that forſaketh any profit, or credit, or comfort, for Chriſts ſake, ſhall bee rewarded an hundred fold. The man that refuſeth to walk in the paths of the vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhall bee bleſſed vpon earth, his ſoule ſhall dwell at eaſe, the Lord will deliuer him out of the hands of his enemies, God will be a Sun and ſhield vnto him, and no good thing wil he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold from them that walke vprightly. His heart ſhall delight it ſelfe in God, and he ſhall ſee the ſhining of the louing countenance of his Father. His ſoule ſhall be ſatisfied, as with marrow and fatneſſe, and he ſhall become like a watered gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. If man forſake him, the Lord will ſtand for him; and though parents caſt him off, yet God will gather him vp: the Lord will couer his head in the day of battell, the Lord will feed him in the time of famine, the Lord will turne his bed in the time of his ſickneſſe, hee ſhall ſee the face of God in righteouſneſſe, and when hee awaketh, ſhall bee ſatisfied with his Image. O how excellent is the louing kindneſſe of God to them that waite vpon him! they ſhall be abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſatisfied with the fatneſſe of his houſe, and he will make them to drinke of the Riuers of his pleaſure: he ſhall delight himſelfe in the Lord, and God will giue him the deſires of his
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:8041:84"/>heart. Let vs often renew theſe meditations in our ſelues, and ſay with <hi>Dauid; O how great is thy goodneſſe which thou haſt laid vp for them that feare thee, which thou haſt wrought for them that feare thee, before the ſonnes of men!</hi> Surely the ſight of this goodneſſe of God, will make the labour of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification ſeeme eaſie. If thoſe that trie maſteries, be continent in all things, for a mortal Crowne, what ſhould wee bee for an immortall? If the hope of bootie will make a ſouldler hazard his heart-blood, what ſhould we doe in this battell, where the fauour of God, and the Kingdome of Heauen are aſcertained to him that fights and conquers? If the man that is in ſome degree mortified, did often contemplate the felicitie that God hath prouided for him, both preſent and to come, hee would not, he could not faint. Theſe meditations would ſo diſgrace the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſinne, and ſo commend vnto him the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of pietie, that hee would euen ſcorne to ſerue ſo baſe a thing as ſinne, which giues no wages, but chaffe and dirt; when hee might be intertained in the ſcruice of Chriſt, who (beſides his being ſo infinitely excellent) giues the ioy of his ſaluation to his ſouldiers for their ſtipend. Put your ſelues in mind often, O ye ſeruants of God, of the conſolations of the Word and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, of the Ioy vnſpeakeable and glorious, of the Peace that paſſeth all vnderſtanding, and of the hidden treaſures, which neither eye hath ſeene, nor eare hath heard, nor mans heart conceiued, but God hath prouided for you, by his Grace,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:8041:84"/>and reuealed to you by his Spirit, and will reach vnto you with his hand. If you will reiect the pleaſures of ſinne which are but for a ſeaſon, and endure the paines of fighting the good fight of fiath: you cannot faint in this battell, if you lend your thoughts to theſe encouragements, you cannot but account all your labour eaſie, if you conſider the reward and end of your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Laſt of all, we muſt much and often pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vpon the death of Chriſt: who he was,<note place="margin">Of Chriſts ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</note> what he ſuffered, why, and for whom, with the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, cauſe, effect, and end of his ſufferings, that ſo we may worke in our ſelues a loue and feare of God, a baſe eſteeme of our ſelues, with an holy ſorrow and indignation againſt ſinne. The death of Chriſt, muſt be the death of our ſinne, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Croſſe muſt we crucifie theſe luſts of our fleſh, that they may waxe faint and feeble, and bee quite and cleane aboliſhed in vs. Here wee ſhal ſee the exceeding hatefulneſſe, and miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſneſſe of ſinne; here we ſhall ſee how odious it is to God, and how harmefull to our ſelues. Here we ſhall fee the infinite loue of God vnto vs, and his moſt gracious readineſſe to forgiue and helpe vs. This thought will be moſt auaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, to ouerthrow the power of all vngodlines in vs. The Sonne of God, the King of Heauen and earth, was abaſed and humbled, and ſmitten, and wounded for our tranſgreſſions. They lay heauy vpon his ſoule, they preſſed him downe to the duſt of death: he died for vs, that hee
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:8041:85"/>might redeeme vs to himſelfe, and make vs a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar people, zealous of good workes. O ſhall wee not abhorre and deteſt that, which was ſo vnſpeakeably grieuous to our Sauiour? Shall we not ſhew our loue to him, in caſting from vs thoſe things, that cauſed him to be a man of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, and to haue experience of infirmities? How bitter and tedious was ſinne vnto him, and ſhall it be delightfull vnto vs! How did it make him ſigh, and crie, and groane, and bleed, and ſhall we take pleaſure in it? Shall we not ſhew our ſelues thankefull to him, that was ſo pitifull to vs, that hee had rather himſelfe indure the curſe, then that wee ſhould bee ouer-whelmed with it? Let vs often looke to him whom wee haue pierced; often conſider of his torment and agony, and often renew in our ſelues, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his curſed and reprochful death, and weane our hearts from the loue of vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and make vs conformable vnto his death. We cannot bee hold to doe euill, if wee conſider well, how much euill he ſuffered for our euill doings. Now theſe thoughts (if wee accuſtome our ſelues vnto them, and doe many times ſequeſter our ſelues from all worldly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations, to enlarge our hearts in them) will be as a ſword in the throat of our luſts, and preuaile mightily to wound them to the death, and as it were, to let out the heart-blood of them.</p>

Bleſſed is hee that feareth alwayes, for this feare will bee the cauſe of ſafety to him. Whiles a ſoulier feareth his enemie, he keepes his harneſſe vpon him, and wil not diſarme himſelfe, ſo long as he miſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the approch of an enemie: But ſecurity makes a man lay his weapons aſide, and giue himſelfe to pleaſure, eaſe, and ſleepe, and then if an enemie aſſault him, he is ſoone ſlaine, or put to flight. he that is afraid of falling into ſome deadly ſickneſſe, will eaſily bee perſwaded to looke to his diet, and to take ſome neceſſary phyſicke. Say therefore in thy ſelfe, O if I grow careleſſe, ſinne will quickly grow ſtrong in my weakeneſſe, and quickly raiſe vp it ſelfe againſt me, and doe my ſoule more miſchiefe then tongue can expreſſe! how haue many of Gods Saints beene foyled, that were farre and farre better then my ſelfe? ſhall not their miſery bee my warning? If ſuch Worthies were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne and wounded, what will become of me? If I grow fooliſhly bold, and make too
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:8041:86"/>faire promiſes to my ſelfe: feare leſt one ſhall fall, will keepe him vpright, euen in a very ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery way: but ſoone are his feet caught from him, that looketh about, and neuer ſuſpecteth a fall. A moderate doubting of our own ſtrength, will quicken vs to prayer and meditation. This vertuous ielouſie and ſuſpition of our weaknes, will make vs ſhunne the occaſions of ſinne, and ſo preſerue vs in ſafety, when others that are more ventrous, ſhall be ſooner foyled, though they be more ſtrong: when we feare our ſelues moſt, wee pray moſt to God, and moſt truſt in him; and prayer and confidence will keepe vs in ſafety. Indeed, we neuer caſt off this warineſſe, and cautelouſneſſe, till wee bee firſt beguiled with the deceitfulneſſe of ſinne; and when it hath deceiued vs, it will eaſily doe vs a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe. Looke about, therefore, ſee how thou ſtandeſt inuironed with enemies, ſee what an ill nature thou haſt within thee, what a violent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary without thee. Thou art like a beſieged City, full of traitors, the wiſe men in ſuch a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, will quickly miſtruſt and doubt the worſt; they will euer ſuſpect, that miſchiefe is plotting againſt them, and by fearing, they become care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to preuent it. There is an exceſſuie feare that infeebles the knees, and weakens the hands, when a man caſts off hope, through feare, and will not perſwade himſelfe that hee can be ſafe by all his indeuours. Courage is gone, when ſuch feare enters; and what ſouldier can doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, when his heart failes? But a moderate
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:8041:86"/>feare, that ſtill cauſeth a man to caſt the worſt with in himſelfe, but alone conditionally, (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he be very diligent to preuent it:) this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakens courage, and by telling of the danger before, doth call vp the care of the ſoule, to preuent it. Feare was placed by God in the ſoule, as a Watchman or Sentinell, to diſcouer neere-approching dangers: and if wee wake this Sentinell, to keep his ſtanding place, and to hold his eyes from ſleeping, wee ſhall bee ſafe from the danger that will ouerwhelme the careleſſe. Feare of man breeds a ſnare, feare of pouerty, feare of death, feare of diſgrace in the world, puts vs further into the danger; but feare of ſinne, feare leſt wee ſhould prouoke God, wound our conſciences, and ruſh vpon ſuch courſes in our folly, which wee ſhall haue cauſe to rue euer after: this breedeth ſafety, and by this feare, wee ſhall happily fulfill our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Laſt of all, wee muſt be watchfull,<note place="margin">Watchfulneſſe neceſſarie to mortification.</note> which will ſurely follow from our being fearefull; for feare will hold the eyes open a great while to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.

A marking, what we thinke, ſay, do, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we goe, to what end, vpon what warrant, vpon what calling, that wee be not found looſe and wandring, and going, wee cannot tell why, nor whither, our ſelues. The ſoule is ſaid to bee awaken, when the eye of the minde is thus ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruatiue
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:8041:87"/>of it ſelfe; and ſo long as it is thus with vs, the leaſt ſtriuing of luſts is noted, and reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and ſo the greater diſorders are preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but when this obſeruation of our ſelues is abſent, ſinne gets head by little and little, and we find our ſelues in the hands of it, all of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and know not how to get out. Wherefore, to all the parts of Chriſtian armour, watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe muſt be ioyned: for what good can wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons do to a ſleeping man? and how can a ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping body fight, though hee bee neuer ſo well armed? When we forget that godlineſſe is the maine buſineſſe, and that our chiefe worke is, to keepe our felues vnſpotted of the world, and walke worthy of the calling whereto wee are called, and ſo ſuffer our minds to bee drawne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with other things, and neuer take care whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the things we doe be good or euill for our ſoules, nor whether they pleaſe God or no, but let the thoughts and words runne at randome, as it were; O how ſoone ſhall we be drawne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin, and how quickly will the members that are on earth grow big within vs! Wherefore, as an eye muſt be had ſtill to mutinous and tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous ſubiects, and they muſt bee obſerued what meetings they haue, to what places they goe, and what countenance they beare; ſo muſt we doe with our ſinnes. The eye of the minde muſt bend it ſelfe to theſe things, and not ſuffer any leſſe needfull matter to diuert it. A man in a ſleepe is little different from a dead man; and a Chriſtian and ſanctified ſoule, if it fall aſleepe
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:8041:88"/>in a careleſſe neglecting, and reckeleſſe diſregar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of its owne wayes, will behaue it ſelfe for the time but a very little better, then one that is dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes. Now let your eyes bee alwayes open, and bent vpon your owne wayes, and then you ſhall walke like liuing men indeed. Thus now haue I ſhewed you the beſt meanes I can gather out of Gods Word, to make you proſperous in your ſpirituall battailes. Bee moderate in the vſe of bodily contents: Flie farre from the occaſions of ſinne: Powre forth your hearts often before God in confeſſions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts and Prayſes. Buſie your minds continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, in thinking of Gods holy nature, fearefull threats againſt ſinne, and gracious promiſes to the vpright, and of the bitter Paſſion of your bleſſed Sauiour. Be alwaies fearefull of your ſelues, be alwayes watchfull ouer your ſelues. Theſe things doe, and your ſoules ſhall thriue, and your luſts ſhall die, and you ſhall happily mortifie your members which are on earth, if alone you take another direction with you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the manner of vſing theſe helpes.</p>

Euery harmefull beaſt is eaſilieſt killed, when it is youngeſt. The Whelpes of a Lion or a Beare, are ſoone and ſafely diſpatched; let them grow longer, they will waxe ſtronger, and cannot be ſlaine without more trouble, and more perill. The firſt moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſinne, are like Lyons Whelpes, let them continue a while, they will be as young Lyons, let them haue libertie to get out at the tongue, they will prooue ramping and roaring Lyons.

Let a man content and pleaſe his fancy in that motion, and nouriſh the deſire, by being ſatisfied in it, and at laſt giue way to ſome wanton words, and ſome degrees of dalliance, his prayers will not be auaileable,

He that ſets not himſelfe againſt his moſt beloued ſinne firſt and moſt, doth but preuaricate (as they terme it) that is, obiect in ieſt againſt other ſinnes, he ſeemes to fight with ſinne, but he is not in good earneſt. Til the Lord did ſmite the firſt-borne, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would neuer yeeld to let Iſrael goe. We muſt kill the firſt-borne, elſe ſhall wee neuer pull our necks from vnder the yoke of ſpirituall bondage. Know therfore, what is the chiefe corruption of thine heart, whether it be pride, ſullenneſſe, carnall ſorrow, anger, reuenge, luſt, worldlines, deceite, or whatſoeuer elſe. Conſider what ſinne is moſt common in men of thy calling, ranke, age, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition temperature.

Now hauing found this, here begin thy warfare, here continue it with moſt heate and earneſtneſſe, make all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, without all delayes, to cut off this mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber on earth, and vſe all diligence, and all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, to pull out this eye of the fleſh.

And laſt of all,<note place="margin">Spiritually.</note> vſe all the meanes thou vſeſt againſt ſinne ſpiritually, and in faith, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending vpon the things done, nor vpon our owne worth or ſtrength in doing, but vpon the Spirit of God, and his bleſſing for ſucceſſe. We muſt looke vp vnto God for the fruit of all his ordinances, and of our labours, promiſing our ſelues good ſpeed, but from God, not from our ſelues. In his ſtrength we muſt be ſtrong, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming all the things that hee commandeth in obedience, but ſtill acknowledging, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him we can doe nothing. The Lords ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers muſt make mention of the name of the Lord their God, and ſay, Through him we ſhall doe valiantiy, and he will tread downe our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies vnder our feete. Our feete muſt tread them downe, but God muſt tread them downe with, and vnder our feete. Therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.10.</note> before he ſets downe any part of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Armor, begins his directions, and makes entrance thus: Finally my Brethren, be ſtrong
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:8041:91"/>in the Lord, and in the power of his might. We muſt be ſtrong, but not in our owne ſtrength; we muſt be powerfull, but not in the power of our owne might.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.11.</note> He that rayſed vp Chriſt from the dead, muſt quicken our mortall bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in vs, ſaith the Apoſtle. This is the moſt important conſideration of all the reſt in the point of our ſpirituall warre, to know whence our ſucceſſe, and ſtrength to get ſucceſſe, and all, muſt come; that ſo we may bee full of aſſurance to preuaile, not through the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency that is in vs, or the excellencie and prayſe-ableneſſe of our endeuours, but through him that inableth vs. It muſt bee a power by meere and free Grace, created in vs, continued in vs, renewed in vs, by which wee muſt oppoſe our ſelues to theſe deadly enemies of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Let the Chriſtian bee as full of hope, yea, aſſurance, as is poſſible, but let him build his hope and aſſurance without himſelfe, euen vpon the meere fauour and goodneſſe of God, that hath promiſed to fight for vs. The vſe of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall meanes thus ſpiritually, is the mortifying of the deeds of the body by the Spirit. And thus we may ſay to our ſelues aſſuredly, as <hi>Dauid</hi> to that Philiſtian Champion,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 17.45, 46, 47.</note> 
                        <hi>I come againſt thee in the name of the Lord God of Iſrael, and we ſhal preuaile againſt you; for God will giue you into our hands.</hi> Thus I haue informed you of the moſt pertinent things that you ought to know, for your better helpe in the worke of mortification; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of it, the meanes of it; and the manner of

The Lord hath ſounded the Trumpet to battaile, and as a Generall, hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the ſignall; haue you prepared your ſelues, and been forward to fight like good and valiant ſouldiers, or haue you not? When ſuch a point as this, concerning our dutie, is taught, we can neuer apply it with fruit vnto our ſelues, vnleſſe wee begin thus to ſearch and inquire into our ſelues, how we haue performed our dutie. No ſound humiliation, no true comfort, will ariſe to the ſoule from hearing the Word of God, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we conſider our owne wayes, and rightly informe our ſelues of our carriage, in what ſort we haue practiſed that, that God hath enioyned vs. This dutie, you ſee, is plainely inioyned, many ſoun reaſons doe confirme it, many eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent texts doe bind our conſciences vnto it.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:8041:92"/>Gods will is manifeſt, wee ſhould therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of our owne ſoules, Haue I been obedient to theſe commandements, or haue I not? Haue I been carefull of doing Gods will, or haue I not?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Many men remaine ignorant of their owne eſtates, and liue in the continual neglect of good duties, and yet perceiue not their owne faulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, becauſe they neuer take paines to look vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their wayes, and to doe that, that <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, would clenſe their wayes, euen to take heed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, according to the Word of God. There be a number, which pleaſe themſelues in a good opinion of themſelues, and take it for granted, that they be good Chriſtians; when indeed they are nothing leſſe then that, for which they doe account themſelues; and the cauſe of this miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, is ignorance and heedleſneſſe, either they know not what is the dutie of a good Chriſtian, or they neuer aske of themſelues, how they haue diſcharged that dutie. We haue done our beſt, to helpe you againſt ignorance in this matter, and to make you ſee plainely what you ſhould doe. We are now to perſwade you to help your ſelues againſt careleſneſſe, by trying your ſelues at the true touchſtone, that you may rightly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne of your owne eſtates, and not bee guilty of negligent omiſſion, without knowing it. I pray you Brethren, what ſhall it profit your ſelues, to call your ſelues after the name of Chriſt, if you haue no good aſſurance, that that honourable Name doth of right appertaine vnto you? It is eaſie to clothe ones ſelfe with the outward habit
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:8041:92"/>of true religion, and to put on the garments of externall profeſſion of piery: but all theſe muſt be pulled from vs at laſt, we muſt be ſtripped of formes and ſhew, and found to be ſuch as we are indeed, and not ſuch as wee haue barely appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. If thou haue carried the name and face of a ſouldier of Chrit Ieſus, and yet haue not fought for him according to the militarie oath and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, wherein thou haſt tyed thy ſelfe vnto him, he will giue thee no prayſe, nor no wages, for hauing abuſed his name and his colours, and made a faire ſhew to no purpoſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Wel then, Brethren, it is altogether needful as to doe, ſo to know whether wee haue done the part of good ſouldiers; and this wee cannot know aright, vnleſſe wee doe well conſider of our ſelues. The ſoule of man if farre in loue with it ſelfe, and will ſoone iuſtifie it ſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe, and beguile it ſelfe with vaine words, ſaying, I haue not ſinned, when he hath ſinned; and, I haue done my dutie, when I haue not. <hi>Saul</hi> boaſted,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.</note> that he had gone the way which God had ſent him to, and done the work which God had ſet him about, and would not be conuinced by the bleating of thoſe Sheepe, and lowing of thoſe Oxen, that ſhould haue been paſt bleating, and paſt lowing, if hee had done according to his ſayings: yet hee did but coozen himſelfe with a verie falſe conceite. Many a man ſpareth his luſts and corruptions, and they bleate and low in the eares of all men, and yet themſelues will not heare them ſo, as to bee driuen from
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:8041:93"/>a fond conceite of themſelues, that they bee mortified men indeed. We ſee how eaſie it is for a mortall and corrupt man, to entertaine a good opinion of himſelfe without ground. But now let mee bee bold to vſe the words of the Apoſtle in another caſe, let no man deceiue his owne ſelfe, and be not deceiued; for God is not mocked. How is it then, my Brethren? Be you mortified men, or be you not? Know well what this thing is, afore you ſay, you are mortified, or the contrarie. A wanne countenance, a look caſt downe, niceneſſe in ſome externall formes of diuine Seruice, a rough cenſuring of others, a buſie finding fault with euery man, auſteritie of carriage, and ſowre cenſoriouſneſſe, theſe are not points of mortification; it is the killing of our owne ſinnes, by the power of the Word of God and Prayer. It is to ſeare our ſelues, and watch ouer our ſelues with ſuch vigilance, till wee haue been able at leaſt to forbeare the practice of groſſe faults vſually, and the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of all, it is this, I ſay, that is meant by mortification.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Now let me examine each of your ſoules in Gods ſtead. What paines haſt thou taken, and doeſt thou take, againſt thy ſecret and moſt beloued Luſts? What Prayers? What Meditations? What feare? What care? What watching? What abridging of thy ſelfe? What circumſpection haſt thou vſed to make ſinne dye? What coſt and toyle, as it were (for without coſt and toyle, warre can neuer bee
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:8041:93"/>maintained) haſt thou been at, in warring againſt the enemies of God, and of thine owne ſoule? Where be thy victories againſt pride and vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorie, againſt enuie and reuenge, againſt wrath and bitterneſſe, againſt luſt and wantonneſſe, againſt worldlineſſe and couetouſneſſe, againſt guile and deceite, and the other troope of luſts that doe ſwarme in the liues of men? Shew me ſome of theſe ſinnes lying dead at thy feete, or bleeding, and ready to die, much mangled, and much wounded. Where are thy heapes vpon heapes, as once <hi>Samſon</hi> ſaid, ſeeing thy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons are farre ſharper, then the Iaw-bone of an Aſſe, that hee was driuen to make a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon of? Thou profeſſeſt to bee a Chriſtian, that is to ſay, a fouldier of Ieſus Chriſt our Lord: Goe to then, if thou wouldeſt be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a valiant and a good ſouldier, canſt thou ſay of thy ſelfe, as they ſang of <hi>Dauid</hi> once; <hi>Saul hath ſlaine his thouſand, and Dauid his tenne thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand?</hi> At leaſt, Canſt thou bring mee to one <hi>Siſera,</hi> whoſe head thou haſt pierced, and made to lye groueling vpon the ground before thee? Brethren, conſider whether you haue done any ſuch ſpirituall exploit, or no, and thinke not well of your ſelues without cauſe. It is not vſing bigge words, and making frayes, that makes a good ſouldier, but killing the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Prince. What one or more of theſe mortall foes of God, and of thy ſoule, haue loſt their liues by thine hands? A man may, if hee will, know whether he haue killed his ſins,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:8041:94"/>yea or not. It is not ſo ouer-hard to find, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſinne haue receiued its deaths wound, by our skilfull and valiant vſing of the ſpirituall weapons, wherewith Chriſt hath furniſhed vs; or whether it yet doe walke healthily, liuely, and at libertie within vs. I ſay, this is not ſo hard a thing to find, but that wee may find it, if wee will not wittingly beguile our owne ſelues.</p>

Alaſſe, this is to take ſinne priſoner a little, and to keepe it aliue for a ranſome; this is not to kill it, this is far from mortification. There are ſome that content themſelues in a few things to walke orderly, but for other faults, they excuſe them, and defend them, and ſooth them, and keepe them warme, and ſo fight for ſinne, and doe not fight againſt it. There bee ſome, that if to ciuill righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they adde a forme of pietie, comming to Church at times appointed, receiuing the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when others doe, ſaying their prayers morning and euening, and now and then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a Chapter in the Bible; if, I ſay, they doe thus much, they count themſelues excellent Chriſtians, though they neuer did know what it meant, to bee in fight againſt their owne diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered luſts and affections, nor euer took any paines in that kind, wherein mortification con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth. There are ſome, that if they can out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrip the common ſort a little, and keepe a courſe of religious exerciſes in the families, and flocke to heare good Sermons, and then bee hot and ſharpe againſt Biſhops and Ceremonies, and crie out againſt the faults of the times, and blame Magiſtrates and Miniſters, and euery mans faults, with a great ſtorme of words, that then doe count themſelues Standerd-Bearers in the Campe of Chriſtians, whereas they are not able to ſhew any ſinfull luſt and affection morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:8041:95"/>in them, whereas they neither ſee nore care to ſee nor reſiſt the wrath, pride, enuie, bitternes, worldlineſſe, vnmercifulneſſe, contempt of their brethren, and other foule vices, wherewith their liues are made to ſtinke in the noſtrils of all that can ſmell any thing.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. All theſe, my Brethren, all theſe, whateuer they may ſay and dreame of themſelues, bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified, and voyde of ſanctitie. And whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer amongſt you is ſuch an one, we aſſure him, that Chriſt will neuer acknowledge him for a good ſeruant, nor crowne him as a good ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier. Whatſoeuer man he be, of what wit and learning ſoeuer, of what tongue and ſpeech ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, of whatſoeuer forwardneſſe in religion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, and of whatſoeuer ſtrictneſſe in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward matters, if the corrupt luſts of his heart lye quiet within him, if the foule vices which origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne haue planted in him, doe liue at peace within his ſoule, and hee neither obſerueth nor bewaileth, nor ſubdueth them; I dare boldly ſay, that man is but a whited tombe, and a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſepulchre. Many men pleaſe themſelues much, becauſe they haue a quarrell to other mens faults: but deale blowes as freely that way as thou wilt, if thou doe not ſtrike as fiercely at thine owne members, thou art no better then <hi>Iehu,</hi> though in thy wrath againſt others, thou ſheweſt as much furie, as did <hi>Iehu</hi> in his march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt <hi>Ahab,</hi> and as much (as thou coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt it) zeale, as hee did againſt <hi>Ahabs</hi> Family, and <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts.</p>
                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:8041:95"/>
                     <p n="4">4. But there are ſome of Gods Saints that fight in this battaile, but with a very faint hand, purſuing their luſts, as Iſrael did the Philiſtims,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 14.24.</note> when <hi>Sauls</hi> raſh oath had made them almoſt to ſtarue themſelues for hunger, as it were, with a languiſhing foote and hand. They ſet againſt finnes, ſometimes, but not often, not continually; they doe not count it the maine matter, as ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers doe, and let all other things giue place to that: they are more eager againſt the faults of others, then againſt their owne faults, though ſome paines they take this way too. They ſee ſome corruptions, and reſiſt; but they are not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent enough, in ſtriuing to find out all their euill inclinations, and to ſet againſt them. I know not how you may better find it, then words can expreſſe it, but they fight againſt many ſinnes, but by the haules. Hence it comes to paſſe, that they doe catch many wounds, and breake out diuers times, into many ſuch words and deeds, that doe both blemiſh them, and vexe them much, and yet they cannot take warning, but becauſe other things doe diuert them from the ſtudie of mortification, they grow ſlacke and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe againe. Doubtleſſe, my Brethren, he that behaues himſelfe coldly in this fight, is but a weake Chriſtian, whateuer knowledge he haue gotten, and whateuer name of forwardneſſe he hath attained. And ſure, many that are of great note, becauſe they can ſpeake well, are yet here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by proued not to be ſtrong men, but euen babes in Chriſt at beſt: for alaſſe, how farre are they
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:8041:96"/>from hauing put to death pride, paſſion, enuy, luſt, worldineſſe, and other corruptions; yea, how much and often doe theſe ſinnes preuaile againſt them? O, let vs ſee our weakeneſſe in this: for not as wee know and can ſpeake, ſo is our goodneſſe, but as wee can mortifie the members that are vpon the earth. It is not brauery of ſpeech that makes a good ſouldier, but the blood of his enemies falling before him.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Now therefore to both theſe neglecters of mortification, to him that neglects, it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to him that neglects it very much, let me turne my ſpeech as ſharpely as I can, but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently according to their different offences. To thee that ſatisfieſt thy ſelfe, in keeping ſinne a little cloſe, or at beſt, a little vnder, and to thee, that makeſt a formalitie in Religion thine vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt mortification, and to thee that makeſt a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle flaſh of heate againſt thoſe, that thou calleſt the corruptions of the times, the higheſt degree of thy ſtriuing againſt finne, giuing not truce alone, but peace, to pride, vanity, earthlines, idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, bitterneſſe, reuenge, and other like ſinnes; thou art but an errand diſſembler, I pray thee know it, and I pray thee be aſhamed of it. If thou commeſt to the Word, and it doe not ſhew thee the foule ſinnes of thine heart, and make thee ſtriue againſt them; If thou prayeſt with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or by thy ſelfe, and thy prayers doe not procure light to ſee, and ſtrength to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome thine owne inward corruptions;
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:8041:96"/>beleeue it, what-euer thine owne ſelfe-loue, or the falſe opinion of others may tell thee, thou art but an hypocrite. O, now take it to heart, and be grieued and aſhamed, that thou haſt all this while liued in ſhew a Chriſtian, indeed a Gentile; in ſhew a child of God, indeed a child of the deuill; in a ſhew an heyre of Heauen, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed an heyre of perdition.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. And all you that haue been ſomewhat care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of mortification, but that ſomewhat hath been farre too little, and therefore you find your luſts yet verie ſtrong within you, becauſe your paines hath not been verie earneſt and conſtant to ſubdue them, I pray heare, and receiue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe. What meane you to deale ſo fooliſhly for your ſelues, ſo vnthankefully with God? What meane you to liue liues ſo vncomfortable and diſtracted, ſo vnheauenly, ſo vnhonourable, when you might gaine comfort, ſettlednes, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and a little heauen to your ſelues by morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication? For the moſt part, your ſharpnes vnduly againſt other men (ſometimes for theſe things that be faults, and ſometimes alſo for thoſe that be not) is the chiefe cauſe of your remaining ſo much vnmortified, becauſe you fight too much abroad, therefore you fight too little at home, and loſe ſo much at home. What, meane you to bee many maſters? What meane you to be teaching euerie bodie, more then you ſelues? What meane you to be prying into your Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, &amp; your neighbors, &amp; euery body but your ſelues? and by being buſie-bodies in other mens
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:8041:97"/>matters (as it moſt times fals out) to hinder the thrift of your owne ſoules? Fault-finding abroad is one of the greateſt enemies to mending of faults at home. Now, I ſay, what meane you to deale ſo fooliſhly for your ſelues, as to keepe ſo much adoe about that, that leſſe (if at all) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes you; and to bee ſo remiſſe in your owne boſomes, that your owne ſinnes bee as ſtrong as other mens, and perhaps, ſtronger, though you ſee them not? What, to bring water to quench another mans houſe, when thine owne doth burn as faſt as his? And now why doſt thou deale ſo euill with the Lord they God, as not to purſue theſe enemies to death, which hee hath giuen thee to purſue? Thy chiefe worke is, to mortifie thine owne ſinnes. Hath God promiſed thee comfort here, and glorie hereafter, if thou wilt crucifie thine owne luſts? Hath hee called thee to be his child, inroled thee into his booke, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thee the earneſt of his Spirit, and the pay of ſome preſent Ioy in hope, and all this to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thee, in cutting off the members vpon earth, and wilt thou be ſtill ſo careleſſe in it? O, now humble thy ſelfe before the Lord, and be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorry,<note place="margin">Ioel 2.1, 2.</note> that thy luſts bee yet ſo ſtrong within thee. God ſent a Prophet to Iſrael to chide them, for that they had not deſtroyed the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites, according to his Commandement, by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and they finding themſelues guiltie, lift vp their voyces, and wept, and the place from thence was called Bochim, that is, The place of weepers. I come in Gods name to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:8041:97"/>reproue thee, for that thou haſt not with due care rooted out the euill brood, the naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, as it were, of thine owne euill heart; now therefore at leaſtwiſe bee humbled, and mourne for this thy careleſneſſe.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. Now, I pray you, ſet to the workes, learne of God to know your right enemies, and to fight againſt them. Bee not afraid, becauſe wee talke of fighting the fight ſhall be without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, for in this caſe the onely perill is, not to fight. In other battailes, he that runs away, doth often ſcape better, then he that ſtands to it: but in this battaile, whoſoeuer flyes, dyes, and hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone eſcapeth with life, that fights it out to the laſt. It is a noble quarrell, to fight for life and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie againſt a meere vſurper, that hath no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of title, and yet would make you ſlaues. Sin hath none intereſt to you; the Deuill is not your Creator, that hee ſhould make himſelfe your your Prince and your God. Theſe luſts againſt which we exhort you to fight, they are the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils armies or garriſons, by which he holds you downe vnder his moſt vniuſt and tyrannical go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment. O, rebell, rebell againſt the deuill, kill his Garriſons, ſet your ſelues at libertie. Fight againſt worldlineſſe, enuie, malice, pride, hypocriſie, wantonneſſe, wrath; fight againſt them; reſolue, that thou wilt neuer bee made a drudge by them, as thou haſt been; that they ſhall not haue the command of thine heart, and thy tongue, and thine hand, as they haue had, but that now through the Grace of God, thou wilt caſt away all theſe things. How thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt fight, I haue ſhewed thee before: remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:8041:98"/>thoſe directions, and vſe them, and bee hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie. O that any reaſonable man, much more any Chriſtian, ſhould be ſo baſe-minded, and of ſuch a ſeruile diſpoſition, as to bee content to make himſelfe a ſlaue to any wicked paſſion, to any ſinfull luſt, to any filthie vice, to any of the depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Deuill, that rule for him, and vnder him. What ſay you, men and brethren, will you now ſet in to fight in good earneſt, againſt all your ſinnes? If you will, the Lord be with you, the Lord aſſiſt you, the Lord beate downe your foes before you, and we bleſſe you in his Name, in whoſe Name we haue exhorted you. If you will not, then hardly liue and die in thraldome for euer: for without this fight, there can be no libertie.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But now to thoſe that haue been ſlacke and careleſſe in this dutie, let mee ſound an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larme,<note place="margin">Numb. 10.9.</note> as the Prieſts with the ſiluer Trumpets in the Law, to reuiue their ſpirits, and put new hart into them, that they may with more zeale, and better courage, addreſſe themſelues to this moſt honourable warre. Now, my Brethren, giue more diligence to the mortifying of your earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly members, and let nothing daunt you, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw you from this battaile. Remember the words that <hi>Ioab</hi> ſpake to <hi>Abiſhai</hi> his brother,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 10.12.</note> and make vſe of them for this purpoſe: Let vs play the men for our People, and the Cities of our God, and let the Lord doe that, this is good in his ſight. It is not for your Countrey, and for your Countrey-men that you fight, but for
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:8041:99"/>your owne immortall ſoules that you muſt play the men; and here the battaile is not yours, but Gods; and the ſucceſſe is not doubtfull, but moſt certaine. Nothing can afford thee more comfort, then a conſtant reſolution in this fight; nay, without ſuch reſolution, nothing can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford thee true comfort. By this thou ſhalt ſhew and know thy ſelfe to bee a true Chriſtian, and procure to thy ſelfe an eternall Crowne of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Remember the equitie of the cauſe, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of the warre, the fruit that ſhall redound from it, and the certaine aſſiſtance, acceptance, and reward, that God himſelfe will afford thee from Heauen. That proſperitie that thou haſt already met with in this warre, hath done thee more good, then all the world beſides can doe. Wouldſt thou for a World be in the ſame ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which once thou waſt, before thou tookeſt in hand the mortifying of theſe earthly mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers? More diligence ſhall bring thee a fuller victorie; and a fuller victorie ſhall bring thee larger conſolation.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. All that hot breath which men do ſpend, rather in blaſting the names, then healing the faults of their Brethren (when they are bitter and tart in iudging and condemning them) will be no whit at all beneficiall to themſelues; nay, neither themſelues, nor others, are the better for this warring. Turne your edge another way, and enter freſhly into the fight againſt your owne ſinnes, and let other men alone. Indeed in this warre, as in the naturall, euery one muſt
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:8041:99"/>bee ready to lend aide, by ſeaſonable admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, vnto his fellow-ſouldiers alſo, but the maine worke is, no make good each his owne ſtanding, and to repell the enemies which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is moſt aſſailed by. What words ſhall I vſe to perſwade you to this dutie? Your Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine is Chriſt Ieſus; your fellow-ſouldiers are all the Saints on earth, and the Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen haue all giuen you an honourable example of fortitude and conſtancie; and your enemies be baſe Rebels, and vile Run-awayes. March on then valiantly, and vnder ſuch a Captaine, with ſuch fellow-ſouldiers; agaiſt ſuch aduerſaries, be ready to ſpend your vtmoſt endeauours. You haue but three enemies, that ſeeke to keepe you out of Heauen, and the other two may doe you ſome trouble, but hurt they can doe you none at all, if you keep the fleſh downe, and put to death theſe members vpon earth. All the wicked men on earth, and all the wicked Feinds in Hell, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make vs guiltie of one euil word, or one euil thought, further then the corrupt fleſh within doth take their part, and ioyne with their temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and ſollicitaion. Theſe be the traytors that betray vs vnto Satan and the World. O, therefore vſe them as traytors, purſue them, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them, execute them. And ſo much for thoſe, that in trying themſelues, ſhall bee found either wholly, or in great part careleſſe of this worke.</p>

This worke, I know well, hath prooued painefull to them. It is a tedious buſineſſe to fight againſt the things that corrupt nature loueth ſo well. But as any dutie that God requireth, doth ſtand vs in more labour, ſo ſhall it affoord vs more comfort here, and more bliſſe hereafter. He that hath begun the worke of mortification ſo farre (as I told you before, in ſpeaking of the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of it) that now thoſe ſinnes which once raigned in him, are put downe from their regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; and thoſe corruptions that once have was a ſlaue vnto, are now depoſed from their throne, as it were, and doe ceaſe to command in his members, as once they did, hath much cauſe to reioyce in the ſaluation of GOD, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee find theſe luſts ſtill ſtriuing, and labouring to recouer their ancient ſoueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is certaine, that the Spirit of GOD doth rule in him, in whom ſinne hath ceaſed
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:8041:100"/>to rule. Euerie man is vnder the command of the fleſh, or of the Spirit: euerie man is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the Lord, ruling in him by Grace, or to the Deuill ruling in him by luſt. Satan is a verie ſtrong man, and our owne luſts are his weapons, none can bind this man, and caſt him out: but the Spirit of ſtrength, of which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, Stronger is he that is in vs,<note place="margin">1. Iohn 4.4.</note> then hee that is in the world. Wherefore if any man that was once vnder the yoke of wrath, luſt, reuenge, couetouſneſſe, or any other vile affection, doe find now, that by feruent pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God, by the power of the Word in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meditations applied to him, and by vertue of the death of Chriſt, and other like ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all meanes by him vſed, the Lord hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to pull this yoke from off his necke, ſo as now, in ſtead of taking delight in the euill motions of ſinne, hee is grieued in his ſoule, when ſuch thoughts doe ſtirre in his ſoule, and ceaſeth not to crie to Heauen, till he find them beaten backe againe, and doth not now yeeld vp himſelfe to follow theſe things with greedineſſe, but is vſually able to forbeare the palpable practice of ſinne; and if hee be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in any groſſe manner, hee is greatly humbled and abaſed, and recouers himſelfe with ſpeedie confeſſion, and lamentation, and renewing of his reſolutions: If any man, I ſay, doe find the caſe to ſtand thus with him, hee hath in ſome meaſure fought and preuailed; and now bleſſed bee hee of the Lord, let

                     <p n="3">3. My Brethren, this warre whereinto you are entred, muſt laſt for terme of life. The fleſh and Spirit can neuer bee reconciled, there is no thinking of any peace, but that which will bee worſe then diſhonourable, euen dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; and a ſure warre, is much rather to be choſen, then an vnſure peace, much more then a peace, which will be ſurely miſchieuous. Now by how much the warre will prooue of longer continuance, by ſo much had you need to put on more ſtrength, that you may endure; and a great part of your ſtrength muſt grow from your comforts in your good beginnings. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now, let euerie true mortified man (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the riddle that <hi>Samſon</hi> once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to his companions) fetch ſweetneſſe out of the ſtrong, and meate out of the eater; let them find an Honie-combe in the carcaſſe of the Lyon which they haue ſlaine, and goe eating; let them, I meane, take great conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in the ſight of their happie proceedings in this heauenly worke.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. There bee ſome Worthies of Iſrael, that haue lifted vp their ſpeares againſt many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:8041:101"/>(as it were) and left them all dead in the place: the hearts of ſuch doe nto much need to bee wiſhed to take comfort. The content they find, in perceiuing the ſtrength of ſinne ſo much abated in them, is vnſpeakeable. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> was no more full of ioy, when hee ſaw <hi>Goliah</hi> come tumbling to the ground, then are their ſoules, when they looke vpon this ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that God hath inabled them to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their luſts. No man is able to ſet forth in words, the ioy that growes to a man, who is hard ſet to by a cruell enemie, (of whom hee lookes for nothing but death, vnleſſe hee preuent it by giuing death) when hee ſees him fall downe wounded, and gaſping for breath. O, with what a countenance and cheere, did <hi>Iael</hi> runne to meete <hi>Barak,</hi> and to bring him to the ſight of dead <hi>Siſera?</hi> Surely the content of a ſpirituall man, in his ſpirituall victories, when now his ſinnes are euen breathing their laſt (as I may ſo ſpeake) is no whit leſſe; yea, it is much more ſolid, then that of ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour. Thoſe that haue happily paſſed the brunt of this battaile, and haue their enemies in the flight, rather then the conflict, are (and haue cauſe to bee) the chearefulleſt of all men, they bee like ſouldiers purſuing their foes with that ioyfull ſhoute of victorie, victorie in their mouthes, and they enioy the comfort of their former labour with much thankefulneſſe.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But there are other ſome, that haue not yet attained ſo much ſtrength, nor gotten ſo
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:8041:102"/>much ground againſt their foes. They are now, as it were, in the verie hotteſt of the skirmiſh, the bullets flie about their eares, as I may ſo ſpeake, and their corruptions are violent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, and doe often with great ſtrength hale them, and draw them captiue to the law of ſinne, which is in their members. They do ſometimes get the better, and beate back euill deſires, and find themſelues mightily reſolued to ſinne no more: at other times, euill deſires doe mightily afflict them, and they are well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neere readie to faint and fall, ſcarce able to retaine their purpoſe of goodneſſe, ſcarcely able to hold out in their reſolution of not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; yea, it may bee contrarie to their reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, pulled by the fleſh to do the euill that they hate; but then feeling themſelues woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they ſmart, and bleed, and ſtruggle with their foe, and get vp againe, and againe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelues to their weapons of prayer and meditation, which were almoſt wreſted out of their hands for a time, and come cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and mourning before the Throne of Grace, begging pardon, begging helpe, and ſo againe confirme their Faith, and renew their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and make vp the breaches of their new obedience. Theſe poore Saints (like ſouldiers, whoſe enemies doe yet hold their owne, and make ſtrong reſiſtance) are often full of feare, and care, and doubt, their hearts often droope, and they miſtruſt ſometimes, leſt they ſhall bee vanquiſhed, rather then ouercome. Let
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:8041:102"/>mee therefore apply my ſpeech to he encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of thoſe that need encouragement. I ſay vnto thee whoſoeuer; that art in this caſe, that thy caſe is good and happy, and that thou haſt much cauſe of reioycing in God, notwithſtanding all the trouble and cumber that thou findeſt with thy ſinnes. It is a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thing, and a great and vnſpeakeable fauour of God, that to what luſts thou didſt once do ſeruice with all thy might, thoſe thou now oppoſeſt with all thy might; what corruptions thou didſt follow with greedineſſe, thou doeſt as it were with greedineſſe reſiſt; what thou didſt once place thine happineſſe in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, now it is thy greateſt vnhappineſſe, that thou art inclined to doe. This, I ſay, is an eſtate that ſhould giue thee much comfort. Once thou didſt ſerue ſinne; now thou figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt againſt ſinne: once thou waſt a willing ſlaue to it; now thou art a reſolute ſouldier againſt it. Thou falleſt into ſinne verie ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which thou didſt runne into verie vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. Thou falleſt into farre leſſe euils of that kind, wherein thou didſt once commit farre more grieuous; and now the leaſt degrees of ſinne doe more diſquiet thee, then once the higheſt did; and now thou letteſt not ſo much as the thought of that goe vnconfeſſed and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamented before God, the groſſeſt act of which thou waſt wont to hide, and couer, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, and not to confeſſe. Take courage to thy ſelfe therefore, and enioy the beginnings
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:8041:103"/>of victorie, and bee aſſured of the concluſion. Thou art now in killing ſinne, and thou ſhalt kill it; thou art now buſie in the conflict, and thou ſhalt deuide the ſpoile.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Now, all ye ſuldiers of Chriſt Ieſus, that find in your ſelues the beginnings of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a firme purpoſe of ſoule to continue, reſiſting, ſtriuing, fighting, bleſſe God, that hath giuen you his Spirit of libertie in ſome meaſure, and apply your ſelues now with all your might, to conſummate the worke begun: Let not your hands waxe feeble, nor your hearts faint.

                  <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He reliques of good nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in man ſince the fall, (by the worke of a common Grace preſeruing them) haue taught Heathen men to know, and inabled them to practiſe many worthy duties. Among the reſt, ſome of them haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded in a most affectionate loue to their Countrie, the welfare of which, they haue preferred before their owne liues; and the ruine whereof, they haue been care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to preuent, euen with their owne ruine. Many worthy ſayings haue they writte to this purpoſe, but ſcarce any more diuine, and more deſeruing admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on haue I met withall, then that one of <hi>Tully,</hi> in his booke of <hi>Scipioes</hi> Dreame, where he brings in a dead father (now in Heauen, as he ſuppoſed) encouraging his ſonne to doe ſeruice to his Countrie, (wherein himſelfe had giuen him a most noble and notable example) with this most worthy ſentence: <hi>There is a moſt ſure and certaine place in Heauen for euery man, that ſhall procure the weale of his Countrie, either by freeing it from perill, or increaſing the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe of it any way.</hi> To heare a Gentile tell of Heauen, as of a thing certaine; to heare him tell of certaine places prouided there for thoſe, that ſhould doe
<pb facs="tcp:8041:106"/>vertuouſly; to haue the ſeruice of ones Countrie preſſed on his ſoule with ſo celeſtiall an argument; ſure it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, that ſometimes the light of Nature doth reach further, then many which liue in the boſome of the Church, do attaine. But the purpoſe for which I thought of this ſentence, is, to let it appeare, how great a recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning reaſon doth tell euery man, that he ought to make of his Countries welfaere, how carefull he ſhould be to preſerue it from dangers, to adorene it with all benefits, and to continue, and augment the flouriſhing eſtate thereof. It muſt needs be an happie paines, from which a multitude doe reape commoditie; and that one man deſerueth very well of all men, for whoſe cares or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, all doe fare the better. Now if Nature and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy can giue ſo good inſtructions to thoſe that will attend them, how much more perfectly ſhould wee bee able both to learne, and follow the ſame leſſons? It is a great reproch to him that goes by day-light, if another trauelling alone with a candle, or a torch, ſhall ſee the way better then himſelfe: and without doubt, that eye is very dim, which diſcerneth leſſe by the helpe of the Sun-beames, then another may doe by the helpe of a Lampe or Taper. O, then how iuſt both blame and ſhame muſt be caſt vpon vs, that are nothing ſo regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of our Countries welfare (the most of vs) as were ſome Inhabitants of Heathen Rome and Athens! I would to God therefore, that I could inflame the ſoules of thoſe, that ſhall reade theſe few lines, with a farre more feruents zeale to the proſperitie of this our Church and Nation, then that they had before. If the fire of loue did burne warmer and lighter in our hearts; it would not drie up the fountaine of teares, to which the
<pb facs="tcp:8041:106"/>booke following perſwadeth, but would euen melt and diſſolue our now-frozen hearts into teares. Thoſe that ſtand in places of eminency, may performe many good ſeruices for their Countrie: we ſhrubs that ſit in the ſhade below, can doe nothing worth the naming, but earneſtly to pray for the barke, in which we ſayle, and to lament the things that we ſee, to threaten a miſerable ſhipwracke thereof. He that will iudge of things by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance (and make carnall wiſdome his onely Loade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarre in iudging) can hardly miſtruſt ſo much euill, as thoſe, that make faith in Gods threatnings a counſellour to their forecaſt, must needs most euidently foreſee now ready to come againſt vs. The huge encreaſe of vices amongst vs, the noyſome ſwarmes of wicked men, and wicked deeds, doe aſſure euery one that beleeueth, there is a righteous Iudge in Heauen (who thence beholdeth all the ſonnes of men) that hee will not long forbeare to ſcourge vs ſoundly, for our vnthankfulneſſe to him, and rebellion against him. Lay all things together, and I thinke, there neither is, nor euer was a Nation more beholding to the Diuine Maiestie. What peace? What plentie? What deliuerances? What brightneſſe of heauenly light haue we enioyed now for the ſpace of more then threeſcore yceres? Againe, lay all things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and, I think, there neither is, nor euer was a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more wicked and vngratefull, and that did worſe requite the louing kindneſſe of God. What profanenes? What blaſphemy? What contempt of God &amp; his Word? What ſinnes of all ſorts doe abound and reigne amongst vs? We ſeeme to haue entred into a contention with the Almightie, whether he ſhall be more mercifull, or we more ſinfull; whether he ſhall be more conſtant in
<pb facs="tcp:8041:107"/>doing vs good, or we more obſtineate in ſinning against him. I doubt not but that the ſame faults are found in other Nations, that are in ours, and in places further off from the light, perhaps alſo groſſer faults: but a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſo long and happily enioying the Goſpell, and ſo poorely anſwering the ſeede that hath been ſowne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs, I cannot thinke there is any. What ſhall we doe then? and what will be the iſſue of our not bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth fruite worthy the paines and coſt that God hath beſtowed vpon vs? We may flatter our ſelues, as it is vſuall for men to doe, and promiſe to our ſelues as much good, as our hearts can wiſh: but it is ſure, Gods threatnings ſhall bee fulfilled, and publike ſinnes ſhall bring in iudgements after them, anſwerable to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in greatneſſe, and inpublikeneſſe. Mine inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefore, in ſetting abroad this Sermon, is, to doe the beſt good that I can to my poore Country, in ſtirring vp thoſe that are not ſtarke dead in ſinnes, to ſet their endeauours on worke, for the preuenting of her woes. There is no way left for vs to defend our ſelues againſt Gods hand, but prayers and teares. Mans wiſdome is folly with God: It hurts it ſelfe often, in ſeeking to helpe it ſelfe, and lyes ſnared in its owne ſubtiltie, as in a grin. Mans power is weakeneſſe with God, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten caſts it ſelfe downe, by ſeeking to eſtabliſh it ſelf, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with its owne weight. No, my brethren, no: Not our wiſdome, not our power, but our prayers and teares; I ſay, our prayers and teares; theſe are the beſt fences againſt the calamities, to which our Country ſtands ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. Theſe will pacifie God, theſe will make him ſay, as once he did to the Prophet;<note place="margin">Amos 7.3, 6.</note> 
                     <hi>It ſhall not be, ſaith the Lord.</hi> To the end that I might prouoke ſome to
<pb facs="tcp:8041:107"/>apply themſelues to this ſo needfull a ſeruice for their Countrie, I haue held vp the example of a most worthy man of God, whoſe example, if we would imitate, no doubt but we ſhould procure as much proſperitie to our Nation, as Iſrael inioyed in his time. Set about it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O yee Chriſtian ſoules: You Countrie hath inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt into you: It callengeth at your hands, all the good you can affoord it: It iuſtly claimeth the vtumoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preouement of all your abilities. It ſtands in danger of Gods hand, by reaſon of the ſinnes wherewith it is defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Not your blood (which would you denie?) but your teares are now called for, to waſh away thoſe ſtaines. Heathen men haue fought for their Countrie, ſhall not we ſight for it? They haue giuen their whole bodies, ſhall not wee giue our teares? They haue laid downe their liues, ſhall not wee lay downe our mirth? They haue encountred all perils, ſhall not we endure the labour of mourning and lamentation? I call vpon you in <hi>Ieremies</hi> words:<note place="margin">Lam. 3.18, 19.</note> 
                     <hi>Let your teares runne downe like a Riuer day and night: giue your ſelues no reſt, let not the apple of your eyes ceaſe. Ariſe, crie out in the night, in the beginning of the night watches, powre out your hearts like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before the face of the Lord, lift your hands towards him.</hi> If miſerie come, you will ſurely crie, when crying will auaile but little; crie before it come with ſuch a crying, as may preuent it. O, deferre not to afford this Iland another ſea of teares for its ſafe-gard, and that a better too, then this wherewith it ſtands ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded. The multitude are ſo metamorphoſed into ſtones, that all words are caſt away, which may be ſpent in calling them to ſorrow, But if there be (as ſure there
<pb facs="tcp:8041:108"/>is) in our Nation, any ſmall remnant left, of thoſe that haue hearts of fleſh, now let them witneſſe their loues to their Countrey, in taking vp a bitter lamentation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thoſe crimes, that make a clamor in heauen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it. Crie aloude (I pray you) and out-crie the crying ſinnes of England. God from Heauen hath ſpoken aloud by diuers corrections; He, as a Father loth to ſtrike, hath giuen vs many a faire warning. Let vs not ſhew our ſelues to be wanton children, that will take no warning, that will not beleeue their parents threats, that will needs continue their vntowardnes, till the rod be held vp ouer them, yea, till their skin begin to ſmart with ſtripes. There are many that mourne for croſſes, penurie drawes teares from the eyes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. We weepe to no purpoſe, in weeping for ſuch things. Let our hearts be filled with ruth, for the faults that fill this Kingdome: Let the Lord ſee, that ſome are fit to be ſpared, if for their ſakes, perhaps, he may ſpare all. I pray thee, Reader, be a true friend vnto thy natiue ſoile. Helpe her with thy humble requeſts and earneſt lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. Intercede to God for her with a beneded knee, and a broken heart, and moystned eyes. Not thy money, not thy toyle, not thy fighting, not thine hazard, but thy ſorrowes are called for. Theſe vouchſafe to thy ſelfe, and to thy Countrie, and we ſhall all be ſafe. All ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies here or elſewhere, all Papists at home or abroad cannot hurt vs, if our ſinnes hurt vs not; they ſhall not hurt vs, ſo long as they bee purſued with cryes and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations. God is our King, ſinne is treaſon againſt him: if many commit it, and none bewaile it, he must and will auenge it: but if we ſpare not to grieue for ſin, he will ſurely ſpare to puniſh it. Happy griefe, bleſſed
<pb facs="tcp:8041:108"/>teares, ioyfull ſorrow. The heart of fooles is in the houſe of laughter, the heart of wiſe men in the houſe of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Follow the worthy Prophet into this houſe, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him in it, doe as he hath done, and thy Countrie ſhall enioy thy teares, more then it could doe thy labour, thine hazard, thy ſubſtance. But I must not foreſtall the following Diſcourſe. I hope it will cauſe the good amongstvs, to pitie their Mother, and to mourne for her, that they themſelues may reioyce with her in the fruite of their mourning. Now I commit thee to the following leaues, and them to thee. I would thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt reade them; I would thou wouldeſt conſider them; I would thou wouldeſt practiſe them: and ſo wiſhing thee a much good ſorrow, as in other caſes thou couldſt wiſh thy ſelfe ioy, I leaue thee to his bleſsing, who will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thy ſorrow, and remaine</p>

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:8041:110"/>and know the diſhonour that is done vnto our Maker, by the offences of our neighbours. Euerie good ſubiect is troubled, to ſee his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſubiects prooue Rebels; neither can any good and dutifull ſonne or daughter, behold without ſorrow, the rudeneſſe or vndutifulneſſe of their brethren or ſiſters: nay, a ſeruant that is louing and obedient to his Maſter, is alſo ſorrie at the heart, if his fellow-ſeruants ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſtubburne, careleſſe, and diſobedient: ſo ſhould it be with the faithfull ſubiects, dutifull children, and obedient ſeruants of the liuing God, their very ſoules ſhould be filled with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, and their countenances with ſadneſſe, for the rebellion, diſobedience, wickednes of thoſe amongſt whom they liue. Not alone our owne offences, but thoſe of our brethren alſo, ſhould be as a loade and burden vpon our ſoules. Thus it is reported of <hi>Lot,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. Pet. 2.8.</note> 
                        <hi>that hee vexed his righteous ſoule from day to day, with ſeeing and hearing their vnlawfull deeds;</hi> ſpeaking of his behauiour, when hee dwelt in Sodom. The impurities and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſes of thoſe brutiſh creatures, were euen as a racke vnto his ſoule, and he could not looke vpon their foule and lathſome, and yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and vſuall abominations, but that it did euen torture and torment his hart, no leſſe then a racke would hjaue done his body. So when <hi>Ezra</hi> was informed of the ſinne of them,<note place="margin">Ezra 9.2, 3, 5, 6, &amp;c.</note> that had returned out of captiuitie; hee ſits downe confounded, and faſts, and weepes, and mournes, and in the agonie of his ſoule, puls off the haire
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:8041:111"/>of his owne beard for griefe, and at laſt breakes foorth into a moſt lamentable and mournefull confeſſion of that ſinne. This Prophet alſo had profeſſed before in the 53. verſe of this Pſalme, ſaying; <hi>Horror hath taken hold vpon me, becauſe of the wicked which forſake thy Law.</hi> And <hi>Ieremiah</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth to the people, that if they would not hearken vnto him (to amend their liues accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Word of God, which hee ſhould ſpeake, and had ſpoken) then his <hi>ſoule ſhould weepe in ſecret places for their pride;</hi>

                        <hi>yea, his eye ſhould weepe ſore, and run downe with teares.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe hearing of the inceſtuous Corinths a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable crime, and the great conniuency of the Church of Corinth towards him, did write a letter vnto them about this matter, as himſelfe ſaith,<note place="margin">2.

                        <hi>out of much affliction and angiſh of heart, and with many teares.</hi> Lo, how bitter to the ſoule of the holy Apoſtle, the tidings of the Corinthian diſorders were. He that for ſcourging, ſtocking, impriſonment, ſtoneing, and all heau perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, was ſcarce euer filled with anguiſh (but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reioyced in the ſame, and ſeemed to gather new life by the comming on of new miſeries) is now exceedingly caſt downe, and put into bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter weeping, and lamentation, for the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe committed by one of that Church, and by the reſt tolerated. Yea, our Sauiour Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe (the beſt patterne of all holineſſe and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) did looke vpon the Phariſes (as the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell tels vs) angerly indeed,<note place="margin">Mark. 3.5.</note> as their peruerſenes and wilfulneſſe did well deſerue, but withall,

You ſee proofe enough of the point: let vs further make it good vnto your ſoules, by cleere and euident reaſons to be taken from foure heads: Firſt, from the graces that ought to be in euery Chriſtian heart, which cannot but procure this ſorrow. Secondly, from the nature of ſinne, which is to be ſorrowed for. Thirdly, from the good effects that will grow from this ſorrow.

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is agreed vpon by all,<note place="margin">Reaſons: firſt, from our loue to God.</note> that the hearts of Gods Saints, ought to abound in fernent loue to the diuine Maieſtie, in regard both of thoſe infinite excellencies which are in his holy nature, and the innumerable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations thereof, as alſo of thoſe great and many benefits, which they themſelues doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:8041:112"/>from him. This loue cannot be ſeparated from an earneſt deſire, that he may be honored, ſerued, obeyed, and in word and deed acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and reſpected, according to his owne worth and greatneſſe, and the multitude and greatneſſe of his mercies. Now there is ſuch a naturall ſympathy betwixt the affections of mans heart, and they are ſo mutually ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted each to other in their workings, as it is not poſſible, but that loue to any perſon, and deſire that he ſhould be well dealt withall, muſt needs rayſe vp griefe and ſorrow vpon the beholding of the quite contrarie: For loue muſt needs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get hatred, and abhorring of thoſe things, that tend to thy hurt, and diſhonour of the partie lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, becauſe he that loueth, cannot chooſe but eſteeme and account them euill, yea, and very euill, and if that thing bee preſent with any man which he hateth, and reputeth euill, it muſt of neceſſitie ſtirre vp in him a meaſure of ſorrow proportionable to his hatred. Wherefore this griefe muſt beare witneſſe to the truth of that loue, which, we ſay, wee beare vnto the liuing God, and muſt iuſtifie all thoſe proteſtations, which wee are ready to make, of hauing abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant good will vnto him. For it is in vaine to ſay, we loue, if we bring not forth the effects of loue. It is but painted and imaginarie fire, which yeeldeth forth neither heate nor light: ſo it is but tongue-loue, and lip-affection (which is good for nothing but to beguile our ſelues, and make vs better conceited of our ſelues, then
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:8041:112"/>there is cauſe) that produceth not the true and proper fruites of loue.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, wee doe know and confeſſe,<note place="margin">Loue to men.</note> that our loue to God, muſt alwayes bee ioyned with the loue of our brethren, euen of all that are made of the ſame fleſh with our ſelues. I meane, our hearts muſt bee ſettled in a liking of them, and deſire of their welfare, as of Gods creatures, to whom he hath pleaſed to vnite vs in many bonds. For though the Lord doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, yea, and command vs, to hate the workers of iniquitie (as they well deſerue, becauſe they commit hate-worthy actions,) yet this hatred muſt not be any habituall inclination, or moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the will to their hurt, but alone a ſtirring vp of the affection of diſlike againſt them, or not brooking them, in regard of the euill which they commit; which may well ſtand, and muſt euer be ioyned with the vertue of Chriſtian cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, whereby out of a liking of them, as Gods creatures, we are alwayes prompt, and ready to wiſh and ſeeke their good. Now if we do thus loue them, muſt it not needs grieue vs to ſee that, which we know to be harmefull and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieuous to them? Loue cannot chooſe but breed a fellow-feeling compaſſion, a ſympathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing commiſeration, and ſenſibleneſſe of the loſſe, euill, damage, miſerie, of the partie loued. Wherefore ſinne being (as in the next reaſon we are to ſhew) a moſt dangerous and hurtful thing to the ſoules of them that commit it, it cannot but call for our ſorrow, yea, much ſorrow, and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:8041:113"/>many teares, whenſoeuer we behold it.</p>
                     <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Loathing of ſin.</note> euery Chriſtian man ſhould haue his heart poſſeſſed with a loathing, deteſtation, and hatred of ſinne, that being indeed the firſt and principal, and moſt immediate obiect of hatred, we may call it the chiefe odious thing, in regard of which alone, it is lawful to hate other things, neither is any thing further hatefull, then as it doth ſome way or other participate of ſinne: miſery being alone hatefull ſo farre, as it is an effect and concomitant of ſinne, from which if it be ſeparated (as in the caſe of ſuffering for wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing) it is euen louely and deſireable; but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer doth ſauour of ſinne, in as much as it is ſinfull, is hatefull alſo; and therefore the Word of God commands vs, to be haters of euill. And if a man doe neuer ſo much forbeare ſinne out of other conſiderations of the inconueniences that inſue it, not out of a loathing of it, in as much as it is a contrariety to the will and glory of God, the chiefe good: (for indeed ſinne alone is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly contrarie to God, as hauing no manner of dependance vpon him, nor ſimilitude of him, nor any other relation to him, but alone as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries be relatiues, and as crimes haue reference to the Iudge that is to puniſh them,) I ſay, if in this reſpect of loathing ſinne as ſinne, wee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare it not, our forbearance of it, is not a thing formally good, it is not truly nor ſincerely good, but alone good inſhew, a practice of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, a carcaſſe or painting of goodneſſe. It being then a thing ſo abſolutely needfull to hate
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:8041:113"/>ſinne, as that wee cannot ſay, we haue Gods Image, vnleſſe we reſemble him in this (for hee hateth ſinne with a perfect hatred,) it is therfore alſo neceſſarie, that we grieue for ſinne: for the preſence of a thing lothſome and deteſted, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſeparated from griefe; griefe being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a contraction and paining of the heart at an euill thing preſent, and that muſt needs bee confeſſed euill, which is accounted hatefull. So then we ſhall falſely affirme, that we hate euill, if we ſorrow not to ſee it commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. There are ſome things, which in nature a man abhorreth, and cannot away withall (as ſome cannot endure a Cat, ſome a Mouſe, ſome a Frog, or the like;) now when ſuch a loathed thing, doth of force, and whether he will or no, draw neere to any perſon; experience will tell vs, how grieuous it is vnto him; hee cryes, and ſhreekes, and ſtarts, and ſhewes an extremitie of the paſſion of ſorrow; and if he cannot flie from it, his whole body will weepe, as it were, in a kind of cold ſweat, as if the weeping of the eye were too little. So if ſinne be amongſt the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of things, that we cannot away withall, that we do loath, deteſt, and haue in abomination, we ſhall ſurely teſtifie our abhorring it, by a ſadnes, heauines, deiectedneſſe, contraction, contrition, troubledneſſe, falling, melting and mourning of our ſpirits, when wee cannot chooſe but ſee it committed; for betwixt grace and ſinne, there is as true an antypathy, as betwixt a mans nature and a toade. And therefore ſo much grace (I
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:8041:114"/>meane, ſanctifying Grace) as we haue in vs; ſo much ſorrow muſt we needs haue for ſinne. So haue you the firſt reaſon of the point, conſider the ſecond, which wee fetch from the nature of ſinne.</p>

We may call it, after a ſort, the firſt and chiefe euill, by participation with which, all that is euill, doth become euill; as God himſelfe is the firſt and chiefe good, by participation with whom, all things that are good, doe become ſo. For firſt, ſinne doth moſt of al things (yea, ſolely and alone) croſſe, thwart, contradict,<note place="margin">diſhonours God.</note> and ſo wrong and diſhonour, and ſo offend, prouoke and anger; yea, and after a ſort, grieue, trouble, and vexe the Lord God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: for God himſelfe is not afraid to tell vs, that he is grieued with mens wickedneſſe; that he is laden with them, as a Cart with Sheaues; yea, that men doe wearie him with their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; yea, that it grieued him at his heart that he had made man, when hee ſaw his wickednes. It is certaine, that the Lords excellencie is ſuch,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:8041:114"/>and ſo infinite, that no perturbation cna befall him, to the diminiſhing of his happineſſe and bliſſe, let all the ſinners in the World both doe and ſay, whateuer wickedneſſe they can. But yet ſtill ſinne is a thing of that nature, as doth directly tend to the diſquieting, troubling, and hurting of him, by caſting him out of his throne, by wreſting his authoritie out of his hands, by ſetting his creature in his roome, and preferring the will and pleaſure of the creature (which is leſſe then nothing) before his will and pleaſure, that is more then all things. All this the ſinner doth, as it were, proffer and aſſay to doe, though he cannot effect it: For ſinne is nothing but an oppoſition of the reaſonable creature, to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and commanding will of the Creator. And therefore if it were not, becauſe the Lord out of his endleſſe and vnmatchable power, is able to eaſe, content, honour, nad glorifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe on the ſinner, by a iuſt and deſerued puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſinne, and by cauſing the way of the wicked to periſh, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh, it would certainly prooue, euen a very vexation, miſery, and hurt vnto him. So ſinne is the fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt thing in all the World, offering and attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to do the greateſt miſchiefe in the World, euen to put the Lord beſides his Kingdome, and to rob him of his Soueraigne authoritie and power; and ſhould not a Child of God be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to ſee ſuch a thing as this committed? If we ſee a man offering to wound, cut, ſtab, kil a child, a friend, a neighbour, a ſtranger; griefe doth
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:8041:115"/>amaze vs, we cry out, and our heart bleeds with griefe. The ſinner (eſpecially by groſſe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſinning) doth, as it were, ſtrike at God, endeuours to pierce, wound, and (let it bee ſpoken with reuerence, to ſhew the horrible euil of ſinne) after a ſort, to kill him: for his Beeing and Soueraigntie muſt needs both ſtand and fall together, and ſinne doth directly ſet againſt his Soueraigntie: ſo that if a ſinner could haue his will, the Lord ſhould bee King of all the earth no longer. O hatefull and horrible thing! And ſhall this horrible wrong be offered to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſtie, in the ſight and hearing of one of his children and ſubiects, and hee not crie out againſtit, and bee pained at the very ſoule for it?</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, ſinne is the moſt banefull and miſchieuous thing to the creature, that can be imagined, both to the perſons ſelfe that doth commit it, and alſo to the place and Nation, in which it is committed.<note place="margin">Hurts the ſinner.</note> Vpon the committers ſoule (not to name inferiour puniſhments) it bringeth vnauoydably (vnleſſe griefe and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row come betwixt) the intolerable torment of Gods infinite and vnconceiueable wrath, and indignation; cauſing, that ſo ſure as there is a God, ſo ſure ſhall the ſoule of euery man that aduentureth vpon it, be for euer tortured and fried in the fierie and vnquenchable flames of Hell, vnleſſe repentance (that is, an heartie ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for it, and a carefull amendment of it) doe preuent to danger.

Hence it commeth, that the Sword hath commiſſion to deſtroy, and deuoure; that the ancient man is pierced tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, the young child toſſed vpon a ſpeare, and his braines daſhed out againſt the ſtones; and the virgin firſt rauiſhed, and after hath her guts ript out.

Hence are all the ſtirs and tumults that al Nations haue groaned vnder. This hath made the earth to ſtagger like a drunken man, and the inhabitants thereof to reele vp and downe, like men ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of wine. This is that which caſts the World into a very frenzy, and puts the ſonnes of men vpon the mad humour of quarrelling and killing each other by thouſands, and tenne thouſands at a time. This alſo cauſeth the Lord to ſend the deſtroying Angell againſt a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and giue him charge to lay about him fiercely, ſmiting and killing (as it hath befalne,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:8041:116"/>euen in our owne times and ſight) diuers thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands in one weeke, within the compaſſe of one Citie? How many more then in the whole Nation? The ſweeping Peſtilence, and other infectious diſeaſes, doe come in purſuite after ſinfull men, and ſinfull deedes; and flying in at the windowes, doe emptie the houſes of men, and Townes of inhabitants, till none bee left to walke in the ſtreetes, and trauaile in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes thereof. And neuer yet was there, neuer ſhall there be a ſinfull and wicked Nation, but (one time or other, in the fitteſt ſeaſon, when their ſinnes are growne ripe) the Lord hath, or will diſpatch his Meſſenger, riding vpon the pale Horſe of Plague, together with him that rides on the red Horſe of Warre, to auenge the quarrell of his Couenant vpon it: yea, for this alſo, the blacke Horſe of Famine is appointed to ioyne himſelfe with the other two, to make yet a more full riddance, and take a more full vengeance. Dearth, famine, and ſcantneſſe, want of bread, cleaneneſſe of teeth and emptineſſe, and the lingring conſumption and pining away of the body, for want of victuall: theſe tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting euils doe come on the World, to puniſh the wickedneſſe of the World.

Sinne doth ſometimes ſhut vp the bottles of Heauen, and make the Sun (as it were in an anger) to burne vp Corne and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:8041:117"/>Graſſe, and the neceſſarie prouiſion for mans ſuſtenance. Sometimes againe, it doth open the ſame bottles ouer-long, and cauſeth the clouds as in a rage, to drowne vp the fruits of the earth, that men and beaſts ſhould feede vpon. This alſo makes the earth it ſelfe, as it were, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted to mankind, and (euen quite and cleane againſt her proper diſpoſition) to refuſe to yeeld her encreaſe for their vſe. Neither was there euer a Nation vnder Heauen, of what profeſſion ſoeuer, Chriſtian or Heathen, but that the Lord hath taken his fit times, to diſcouer his anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their ſinnes, by with-holding from them the fruites of Nature, and pinching them with ſcarcitie, in ſtead of abundance. And that is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten fulfilled, which the Pſalmiſt ſingeth; A fruitefull Land is made barren for the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of them that dwell in it. Sinne hath ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, poyſoned, ſtarued millions of millions of men, and ſent to violent and vntimely ends, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable thouſands of reaſonable creatures and beaſts. Sinne turnes looſe Fire, and Water, and Heauen, and Earth, Sunne and Moone, and Beaſts, and all Creatures, and makes them all to fight againſt Man to deſtroy him; and (which is more miſchieuous) it turnes them looſe one vpon another, to employ their reaſon and ſtrength to their mutuall ruine and ouerthrow. What was that, that drowned the old World? burnt vp Sodom, and the Cities adioyning? conſumed the Canaanites out of their good Land? laid waſte Babel, Edom, Moab, Ammon,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:8041:117"/>and all the other Countries, yea, of Iewrie and Ieruſalem too? and often (to come neerer to our ſelues) the Cities and Countries of this our owne Nation?

But euen this foule, loathſome, odious, and abominable thing, which we call ſinne, the very proper parent and grand-dame of all that euill, that all creatures lye vnder. For lying, and ſwearing, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and murder, and fraud, and oppreſſion; for ignorance and profaneneſſe; for idolatrie and ſuperſtition; for ſwearing, and curſing, and other abominations, the God of Heauen hath a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with the men on earth, and empties his qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of arrowes, and ſends out all his Hoſtes and Armies, to cut them in pieces, fighting againſt their bodies, goods, liues, ſoules, and all, till hee haue ſpoyled them of al comforts here, and ſent them to yell, and roare, and crie, and weepe, and gnaſh their teeth in Hell hereafter, where their ſinnes ſhall be no longer a griefe vnto him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath auenged, and, as it were, comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelfe in the execution of his infinite and perfect Iuſtice vpon them. O my Brethren! haue we not ſaid enough, to make you perceiue, that it was not without cauſe, that <hi>Dauid</hi> made his eyes to guſh out riuers (and that you ſhould make your eyes doe the like) for ſuch a thing as this?</p>

Theſe Riuers of teares doe giue ſo good content to God, and ſo refreſh his ſoule, wearied with ſinne (to ſpeake after the manner of men,) that ſo long as there bee but euen a few of them running, his anger cannot waxe hot to burne againſt a Nation. Amongſt what people there are found a competent num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men that doe wayle,<note place="margin">Preſerues the Land.</note> mourne, and lament for the common ſinnes, this holy exerciſe of theirs doth (as we may ſpeake) tye the hands of Gods Iuſtice for the time, that he will not ſtrike that people with great ſeueritie. He is ſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly pitifull and large in compaſſion, that hee cannot but deferre the execution of his wrath (ſo long as it may poſſibly ſtand with righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to deferre it) vpon the feruent and humble petition of his poore ſeruants, that with ſad hearts, and bended knees, doe crie vnto him, ſaying; O Lord, ſpare thy people whom thou haſt redeemed; and, O Lord God, forgiue and ceaſe, wee beſeech thee; for who ſhall rayſe vp <hi>Iacob,</hi> for he is ſmal? Let ſin be as open and great, and crying, and clamorous as it will, yet if there
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:8041:118"/>be a conuenient nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, fiftie, fortie, thirty, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or perhaps but ten in a Citie, that crie, and weepe, and make bitter lamentation for it; none extremitie of publike iudgements likely ſhall come: Seldome doth God breake in vpon a people, till there be none, or in a manner none left to ſtand in the gap; and when the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procheth, that hee hath a full purpoſe to doe a fearefull execution on a Land, then doth he take away the mourners, and deliuer the ſuruiuours vp to hardneſſe of heart, and carnall mirth and iollity, that ſo he may haue a ful blow at it, when there is none to hinder, and without let powre forth all the vials of his wrath, when there is none ſtands vp to deprecate. O excellent fruit of lamentation for publike ſinnes! it gets a repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall of an whole Towne or Countrie, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that the Lord will not ſuffer his furious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation to ouerflow. So a man is a great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor to his Countrie, by powring forth his teares in this wiſe; and ſhould not Chriſtians, as well as (yea, more then) Heathens, ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues true louers of their Country? But,<note place="margin">Keepes the ſoule from infection.</note> it doth likewiſe preſerue the mourners ſelfe from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of ſinne, cauſing that it cannot ſeize vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſoule, to poyſon it, as elſe the nature of it is to doe, ſo long as he continues to weepe and groane for it. In common plagues, there is great enquiring after preſeruatiues. One commends Rue; another, Wormewood; a third, Holy-thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; ſome this, ſome that, as their iudgement leades them. But beloued, the worſt of all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:8041:119"/>the moſt catching, the moſt contagious, the moſt apt to lay hold vpon all, that come within the breath of them that are ouer-runne with it, is ſinne. The plague it ſelfe, and the moſt deſperate of all plagues, is nothing ſo apt to leape from man to man, and houſe to houſe, as ſinne is. The ſcabs among ſheepe, the murraine among cattel, doe not more ſpeedily ouerrunne the whole flocke and Herd, then wickedneſſe will doe an whole houſe, towne, and Countrie. Onely there is one moſt notable preſeruatiue, which euery man carries about with him, which he need not take paines to ſeeke elſewhere, but in himſelfe, nor be at coſt to buy of any but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and that is ſorrow, griefe, teares, the ſame that the Pſalmiſt here ſpeakes of. And whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he be, that can take but a reaſonable draught of his owne teares, morning and euening, or but twice or thrice a weeke, yea, or ſeldomer, for the ſinnes of the men, with whom hee liueth, ſhall neuer be infected with them, nor drawne by imitation, to like and practiſe them: for the ſoule will neuer agree to doe that it ſelfe, which it is pained in it ſelfe to ſee another doe. Will you not now make for your ſelues, and take this ſoueraigne medicine againſt this peſtilent ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? Oathes, lying, curſing, bribery, ſimony, coozenage, oppreſſion, vſurie, idleneſſe, volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſſe, pride, reuenge and filthineſſe, ſhall neuer catch you by the example of other men, if you mourne for them, and behold them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of others, with griefe and anguiſh of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:8041:119"/>Will you not therefore ſtirre vp your ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, and ſaue your ſelues from the perill of an euill generation? Eſpecially, ſeeing this ſorrow will doe yet more good, by making them,<note place="margin">Makes one care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to redreſſe ſinne.</note> in whom it is, carefull of ſeeking the reformation of others, ſo farre as lyes in them, and their duty and power extendeth. As godly ſorrow for a mans owne ſinnes, will bring forth repentance not to bee repented of, and cauſe him to amend his owne euill wayes: ſo godly ſorrow for other mens ſinnes, will alſo make him ſeeke to draw them to repentance and amendment. This will cauſe him to contend and conteſt againſt ſinne and ſinners, and with all his might (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his place and calling) to oppoſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt both it and them. If hee be a Miniſter, this ſorrow will ſet open his mouth to crie out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and cauſe him to lift vp his voyce like a Trumpet, to pronounce defiance, and ſound war againſt it, on Gods behalfe. If he be a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, it will arme his heart with courage and conſtancie, and all due ſeueritie, ſo that hee ſhall vnſheath the Sword of authoritie, and lift vp his arme, and ſmite the wicked doers ſoundly, with an heart vertuouſly hardned againſt the vices of fooliſh pitie, and of fearefull cowardice. If hee bee but a priuate perſon, it will make him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh, reproue, complaine, and ſollicite Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and Miniſter, and all he can, to procure a redreſſe. Sorrow is a thing ſo much againſt the good liking of Nature, and a burden of which, euery one that ſtands vnder it, is ſo truly and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:8041:120"/>earneſtly deſirous to bee eaſed, that it will ſtirre vp his care to ſhake off the burden, and remoue away that, that doth procure his ſorrow. So ſhall a godly man not alone ſaue himſelfe from ſinne, but bee made an inſtrument alſo (ſo farre as is poſſible for him, if it may be) to ſaue others from ſinne, he ſhall preſerue himſelfe from the contagion, and be inabled, if the diſeaſe bee not paſt cure, to heale them that are diſeaſed. Thus when <hi>Paul</hi> had heard with bitter griefe the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of Corinth, he could not be well, till hee had ſent a letter vnto them, and diſpatched <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> thither alſo, to ſee things better ordered. And when <hi>Ezra</hi> had faſted and wept for the ſin of Iſrael, how carefull was he (with the helpe of the Princes) to redreſſe that abuſe?</p>
                     <p>And from this good effect,<note place="margin">Saues one from the common pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</note> will follow ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther no leſſe deſireable, as a fruite of this; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the mourner ſhall ſaue himſelfe from partaking in the common puniſhment, if it muſt needs come. <hi>Lots</hi> righteous ſoule was vexed, as you heard, with the impure conuerſation of the Sodomites; wherefore the Lord ſent his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, and deliuered him from thoſe flames of brimſtone that conſumed the Sodomites. And the Apoſtle concludeth hence, that God knows how to deliuer his: and ſo it muſt needs hold, chiefely in the like caſe, the Lord will rather euen miraculouſly deliuer thoſe of his people, that ſet themſelues againſt the ſinnes of the times with bitter lamentation, then that they ſhall not bee ſafe, euen then when others are
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:8041:120"/>ſmitten. <hi>Ieremiah</hi> wept for the pride of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and did not the Lord performe his promiſe, and make the enemy to intreate him well in the euill day? <hi>Baruch</hi> and <hi>Ebedmelech</hi> alſo were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the few mourners for Ieruſalem: and had they not their liues giuen them for a prey, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther euer they went, though the Sword of the enemie raged in the houſe, and in the ſtreetes? Yea, doe wee not reade that excellent viſion of the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> how that before the Citie was giuen vp to deſtruction,<note place="margin">Ezek. 9.1, 2. &amp;c.</note> he ſaw the Lords Angell appointed to goe forth with a pen and inkhorne by his ſide, and paſſing thorow Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, to ſet a plaine marke vpon the fore-heads of all thoſe, that had lamented and mourned for the ſinnes of the Citie, and that no plague was permitted to breake forth vpon the reſt, till theſe were marked to eſcape? Loe, how thoſe that ſigh, and crie for the abominations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in a Citie, ſhal ſurely eſcape the miſeries that muſt come vpon that Citie. Teares are able to procure ſafetie to a man, euen in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and common ouerthrow, where wealth, friends, wit, ſtrength, and all other helpes will faile him: for either the Lord will graciouſly, and in mercy take them away from the euill to come, and gather them to their fathers, that they may not ſee the miſery which is to ouerwhelme the people, or elſe he will hide them vnder the ſhaddow of his wings, and by his Fatherly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence for them, take ſome order, that they may goe ſafe in the common deſolation. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:8041:121"/>hold a way of ſafe-guarding your ſelues in the hardeſt times, and of procuring that bleſſing to your ſelues, which vngodly men doe falſely promiſe to themſelues from the vanitie, and lyes, vnder which the Prophet ſaith, they think to lye hid, namely, that when a ſcourge doth ouerflow, it ſhall not come neere you; and that is nothing elſe but to doe, as our Prophet hath done before, ſend vp ſighes and groanes vnto the Lord, for the publike ſinnes; and whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bewayleth the generall wickedneſſe, ſhal al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo bee deliuered from the generall puniſhment. Therfore if any man deſire to be puld, as a brand out of the fire, and to bee one of the two or three berries in the vtmoſt boughes, that muſt hang vpon the tree, when all the reſt are beaten off, let him prouide for his owne peace and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare betime, by making his heart to ake, and his eyes to weepe for the common abominations. And ſo you ſee what good this mourning will do, in regard of the publike State, by proroging the puniſhment ſo long as is poſſible, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his owne ſelfe that mourneth, by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him from the infection of ſinne, making him carefull to ſeeke the amendment of others, and ſo ſauing him from participating in the publike plagues.</p>

The ſoule will be infected.</note> and let them conſider of the euils, that will neceſſarily follow from the abſence of theſe teares. It is certaine, that no man can ſhun the infection of other mens ſins, vnleſſe hee mourne for them; as no mourner is infected, ſo none but mourners can be free from infection. Hee that grieues not for a ſinne that others commit, will eaſily be induced to commit it himſelfe, if occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſerue, at leaſt hee will ſoone bee drawne to like it, and thinke well enough of it, and then the infection hath taken the heart, and hath poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the ſpirits and vitall parts, as it were, of his ſoule, and that is enough to kil a man, though it ſhould bee kept from breaking forth in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward action. Some men, by vertue of a good conſtitution, eſcape the Plague in the hotteſt and foreſt of all plagues, and that alſo, though they vſe few or none antidotes or remedies. It is not ſo with our inward man, in regard of ſin: For of ſo ill a complexion, as it were, and ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound and healthleſſe a conſtitution are all our ſoules, ſince the defiling of our nature by the firſt ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> that any ſinne almoſt doth eaſily, ſpeedily, vnauoydably, cleaue vnto the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:8041:122"/>ſame. The drieſt Touchwood or Tinder that is, doth not more readily take fire by any little ſparke, then our ſoules will catch a ſinne by bad example. And ſinne it ſelfe is ſo ſtrong and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement in the working of it, and withall ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitefull, cloſe, and inſinuating, that it doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inſenſibly conueigh it ſelfe into our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bowels, euen almoſt before we are aware: ſo that vnleſſe we doe moyſten our ſelues often, by the teares of godly ſorrow for ſin; we cannot liue amongſt others, that do euen glow with the fire of it, but wee ſhall alſo burne and glow for companie; neither is there a man vnder Heauen ſo ſanctified, but hee ſhall become wicked with wicked men, if his ſoule mourne not for their wickedneſſe. <hi>Lot</hi> would ſure haue been vncleane in Sodom, if their vncleanneſſe had not vexed his righteous ſoule. Therefore to preuent a miſchiefe otherwiſe vnpreuentable to our ſelues, namely, the being polluted with other mens faults, let vs ſee it a dutie (and follow it) to waſh our ſelues with teares from that polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>Otherwiſe,<note place="margin">A men ſhall be careleſſe of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of redreſſe of euils.</note> wee ſhall alſo pull another euill vpon our ſelues, euen make our ſelues ſlacke, careleſſe and remiſſe, in the endeuour of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the ſinnes of our brethren. Hardhearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in not feeling the burdenſomeneſſe of ſin, will cauſe, that a man ſhall ſit ſtill, and let it take its courſe, and beſtow no paines to redreſſe it: for that that one doth not feele to be euill, why ſhould hee beſtirre himſelfe to amend? And
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:8041:122"/>ſurely hee feeles it not euill, that doth not mourne for it. What was the cauſe that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians did ſo careleſly tolerate the inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon among them? Hath not the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle taxed it in one word, ſaying; <hi>And you haue not rather grieued, that ſuch an one might bee taken from amongst you.</hi> Lo, they mourned not for the ſinne, and therefore they chaſtized not the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in good manner, as they ought to haue done, for his amendment. And ſo will it euer bee in all places and times. In what meaſure ſorrow for ſinne is wanting, care of amending it will be wanting alſo: little of this, if little of that; and if none of that, none of this wil be ſeene in mens liues. This vnſenſibleneſſe of ſinne, is ioyned with too much ſenſibleneſſe of other things; it makes one ſo timorous, that he dares not ſpeake againſt wickedneſſe, for feare of offending ſuch and ſuch: it makes a man fooliſhly pitifull, and cruelly compaſſionate, that he cannot find in his heart to hurt the offender, euen by due executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of iuſtice. He, whoſe heart and eyes cannot performe their office, in grieuing for, and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſinne, neither will his hand and tongue doe their offices, in ſpeaking and ſtriuing againſt it. The ſame corruptions that make the hart ſhort in griefe, and the eyes in teares, will alſo make the tongue ſhort in reproouing, and hand in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing. Neither will any man lay a plaiſter to that ſore, which he thinkes not worth grieuing for; for if it were dangerous, why is not he ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? If it be not dangerous, what need a plaiſter?
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:8041:123"/>And ſo it will follow, that ſinne hauing none enemie to reſiſt it, none to oppoſe and fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, will mightily preuaile (as a fire which no man ſeekes to quench,) and ſo get the vpper hand, till at laſt it grow ſo high, crying, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable,<note place="margin">Publike plagues will come.</note> that the Iuſtice of God can no longer forbeare it, but he himſelfe muſt take the matter into his owne hand. Then follow ſore and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie calamities vpon the Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and the whole Nation groanes vnder Gods blowes, becauſe few or none did groane for the ſinnes that prouoked him. When many commit euil, and none lament it, then the wrath of God will ſurely ariſe, then is ſinne gotten to his full ripeneſſe, and then the euils aboue-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſometimes ſingly, ſometimes altogether at once, are appointed to deſtroy a Nation. All the policie of Gouernours, all the valour and courage of ſouldiers, all the wealth of Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and the loue and friendſhip of neighbours, ſhall not keepe a Nation in welfare, nor mound it from grieuous and fearefull plagues, if once the voice of ſadneſſe and mourning, and of thoſe that crie and weepe for the abominations of it, be put to ſilence. Then will God change their wiſdome into folly, &amp; catch them in the ſnares of their owne craft; and if other meanes ſhould faile, will make them, euen to vndo themſelues. Then ſhall power bee turned into weakeneſſe, and courage into cowardice; for God will fight from Heauen againſt them, as the Prophet tels the Iewes; and if their enemies were but
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:8041:123"/>dead carcaſes, yet ſhould they riſe and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. When all ceaſe mourning, then ſhall all begin ſuffering, for that is a ſure proofe, that ſin is come to his full growth, and that the meaſure of mans wickedneſſe, is repleniſhed euen to the brim. Indeed, what is there then remaining, that can in any reaſon be thought able to moue the mercy of God to longer forbearance? When none bewayleth, or as good as none; when none ſupplicateth, when none pleade the cauſeat the barre of his mercy, how can Iuſtice but raiſe it ſelfe vp, and ſmite the abuſers of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer mercies, with ſo much greater ſeueritie, by how much they haue been longer borne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all?</p>
                     <p>And further,<note place="margin">They ſhall periſh in the common deſtruction.</note> it will come to paſſe from this letting ſinnes ſlip away by them without ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that the children of God (if any few graines of Wheate bee found hidden in the huge heape of chaffe) ſhall periſh in the common deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and bee ſmitten with the reſt, becauſe they mourned not for the reſt, but did rather partake of their ſinnes, by not oppoſing them: for none is in mercy marked for the day of deliuerance, but a mourner. Though a man be for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, vpright and godly, yet if in that particular, hee doe ſo farre degenerate from the rules of godlineſſe, that he remaine ſorrowleſſe, for the diſhonour done to God by others, this vngrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing diſpoſition hath ſo deepely ingaged him into the guilt of thoſe ſinnes, that it will very hardly ſtand with the truth and wiſdome of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:8041:124"/>God, to let him goe free; but he muſt cauſe him (for the good of his owne ſoule) by the ſmart of croſſes, to grieue for ſuch euils, as elſe he would not grieue for. So miſchiefe vpon miſchiefe breakes in, when teares and mourning ſtand not vp to preuent the ſame. A mans ſelfe is infected, he becomes careleſſe of reforming euill, God ſmites the whole ſocietie, for the ſinnes now committed by all, and lamented by none; and then hee that mourned not, muſt himſelfe alſo ſmart for company. Shall we not ſeeke to ſtop the way againſt all, and each of theſe euils, by intrenching our ſelues, as it were, within theſe Riuers of waters?</p>
                     <p>And ſo, Brethren, you haue reaſons great ſtore, to prooue the dutie, and perſwade vnto it. If you loue God, whom ſinne grieueth; if you loue your neighbour, whom ſinne hurteth; and if you hate ſinne it ſelfe, which all ought to hate that loue God and their neighbour; if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how loathſome and grieuous a thing ſinne is, how offenſiue to God, yea, and iniurious, how harmefull alſo to mankind, both to him that dares practiſe it (whoſe ſoule it tumbleth to the bottome of hel, beſides other croſſes of all ſorts, which attend it for the preſent,) and alſo to the Countrie, where it is ſuffered, cauſing the Lord to ſend out Sword, Peſtilence, Famine, and all manner of dolefull miſeries againſt it: If you conſider, that this mourning wil ſurely cauſe the Lord to reprieue the whole Countrie, and that it will keepe the ſoule of the mourner free from
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:8041:124"/>infection, and ſtir him vp to al due meanes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing ſin, and ſo ſaue his own ſoule, at leaſt, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon calamity, when it can now be longer no deferred. And laſtly, if you remember, that where this mourning is abſent, a mans ſoule will ſurely be infected, he wil grow careles of doing that which he ought to doe, for redreſſe of euill, and ſo ſin growing mighty, will infallibly and ineuitably procure a common iudgement, in which himſelfe ſhal alſo, as a man not ſigned for deliuerance, be taken away among the reſt. If, I ſay, you doe acknowledge and confeſſe all theſe things, as they are all manifeſt, and doe ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay them to heart, you cannot chuſe but yeeld in your very conſciences, that you all ought to doe, as the Prophet here profeſſeth to the Lord, that himſelfe was wont to doe, euen cauſe <hi>Riuers of waters guſh out of your eyes, becauſe men keepe not the Law of God.</hi>

Ah, it is moſt euident, that we deſerue moſt ſharpe reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for being ſo ſcant in teares for that, for
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:8041:125"/>which this man of God did weepe ſo abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For where is there, my brethren, alacke, where is there to be found one man amongſt vs, that hath imitated ſo precious, and withall ſo manifeſt example? Where is his dwelling, whoſe face is couered with theſe teares, and cheekes made wet with this weeping? In what corner may we meete with him, or her, that is able to profeſſe in truth before the Lord, and his owne ſoule: <hi>O Lord, Riuers of water haue run downe mine eyes, becauſe they keepe not thy Law?</hi> O, no, no; we are ſold ouer to mirth and iollitie. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, ſlaying of Oxen, and killing of ſheepe, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drinking, and calling to hang ſorrow, as once among the Iewes. Behold; piping and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and minſtrelſey; behold, making out harts fat and iouiall, as in a day of ſlaughter. But alas; Ah, alaſſe; the ſinnes of the Land are not laid to to heart by (almoſt) any of thoſe that inhabite the Land, and for a thouſand ſinners, hardly haue we one weeper. As for the common mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, why, they would thinke him euen quite out of his wits, whoſe face they ſhould ſee blub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berd with weeping in a corner: And why for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth? Becauſe his neighbours be wicked and ill liuing men, and keepe not Gods precepts. Why (would they think and ſay) what is that to him? Shall he beare other mens burdens, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere for other mens ſinnes? Or can hee mend their faults by ſighing and weeping for them? Why then ſhould hee vexe himſelfe for that, which will bere neuer a whit the better, if hee
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:8041:125"/>ſhould vext his heart out, at it? This would be the cenſure of the common and ordinary man, of ſuch a mourner, as the Text ſpeakes of, they would count his teares ill ſpent, and himſelfe a foole for his labour. And as is their iudgement, ſuch is (and ſuch needs muſt bee) their practice. They neuer in all their liues wept one tenth part of a teare, for all the ſinnes and abominable deeds that euer they heard of, or ſaw commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: vnleſſe it haue falne out, that the ſame thing haue been an hurt vnto themſelues, or ſome other man, whoſe caſe they haue tendred, and ſo bemoned the perſon, not bewailed the ſinne; been ſorry for it as an injury againſt man, not as a tranſgreſſion of Gods precepts. But this neglect is not found alone with the vulgar ſort of men. Nay, thoſe that haue gotten ſome good meaſure of knowledge and of vertue, and doe exerciſe themſelues with ſome due care to keep themſelues vnſported of the wicked world, euen theſe alſo, for the moſt part, haue eyes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together drie and teareleſſe, in regard of other mens offences. Who of thoſe that ſeeme to know and feare God, &amp; to delight in his wayes, is carefull to wipe away the ſtaines of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſinnes with his owne teares? Brethren, I demand of each of you; Can you ſay, &amp; affirme, and that truly and ſincerely in the preſence of God, that your eyes doe yeeld forth ſtreames of water for the publike ſinnes?</p>
                     <p>Againe, I propound this queſtion to euery of your conſciences: Art thou able to take vp <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi>
                        <pb n="232" facs="tcp:8041:126"/>words here, and with the good leaue of thine owne conſcience to affirme, as he affirmed, <hi>Riuers of waters, &amp;c.</hi> Doubtleſſe there are but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few, if at all there bee any of vs, that may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme thus much of himſelfe, without a manifeſt accuſation of falſehood in his owne ſoule. If we lament our owne ſinnes, we thinke it abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſufficient, though wee lend no teares at all to bewaile our neighbours faults. Indeed it muſt not bee denyed, that the greater number of teares, and thoſe the moſt earneſt and bitter, muſt be beſtowed by euery man, in lamenting the ſinnes of his owne heart and life: but yet ſeeing God is diſhonoured alſo by the faults of others, and the ſoules of our brethren, as well as our owne ſoules, ought to be deare vnto vs; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be denied, that it is a ſinne, and a fruit of our not ſufficiently hating ſinne, and louing God and our brethren, that we are ſo exceeding defectiue in ſorrowfull teares for their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds, and cauſe enough there is, that each of vs ſhould take vp a grieuous complaint againſt himſelfe, and ſay, O Lord, how vnlike haue I been to thy ſeruant <hi>Dauid?</hi> No flouds, no drops of teares, ſcarce halfe a ſcore teares, ſcarce fiue, ſcarce two, ſcarce one, ſcarce halfe an one, doth proceed from mine eyes for the many and hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous tranſgreſſions, that I doe daily ſee with mine eyes. Where was my loue to thee, Lord? Where mine hatred of ſinne? Where my chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to my brethren? O how iuſtly mighteſt thou ſweepe me away with the Beſome of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:8041:126"/>deſtruction, and bring thy fearefull plagues vpon all of vs, euen my ſelfe amongſt the reſt, becauſe they ſinned, and I wept not for their ſinnes? We are bound, brethren, euen to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie, and to fall out with our ſelues, when wee find in our ſelues a manifeſt neglect of a plaine dutie, ſo euidently enioyned by God, by others ſo plentifully practiſed, and grounded alſo vpon ſo good, and vndenyable reaſons as this is: and therefore now charge thy ſoule before the Lord, with a great ſinne of omiſſion, in that thou haſt forgotten, or nor regarded to weepe in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret for the publike ſinnes. There want not men amongſt vs, that can eagerly inueigh againſt the Words naughtineſſe, and aggrauate the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of others in words, and with a ſatyricall bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe, ſet out the greatnes of their folly. Yea, there are ſome, that can make matters worſe then they be, and ſet a deeper and dirtier colour vpon the ſins of others, then they ought to doe: but among theſe witty and ſharpe reproouers, of theſe vehement and clamorous accuſers, is there any one, trow you, that may be called a weeper, a mourner, a lamenter? It is eaſie to exerciſe ones wit vpon the ſinnes of others, by making them ridiculous, to mooue the ſpleene with laughter. It is eaſie to exerciſe ones ſtomake vpon the ſinnes of others, by violent inuectiues, to make the offenders odious; but it is hard, yea, hard indeed, to exerciſe ones ſorrow vpon the ſinnes of others, to make our ſelues carefull of not offending in the like kind, and of ſeeking to
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:8041:127"/>ſtop them alſo from offending. Diuers may ſay, I beheld the tranſgreſſors, and laughed at them: diuers alſo, I beheld the tranſgreſſors, &amp; chafed at them: but few (alaſſe, how few?) can vſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſentence of <hi>Dauid</hi> in this Pſalme, and ſay; <hi>I beheld the tranſgreſsors, and was grieued, becauſe they kept not thy Word.</hi> Let vs therefore earneſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne our ſelues in our hearts, that haue eyes ſo drie, and void of teares, when we haue a Land ſo naught, and full of ſinne. For Brethren, how ſtands the caſe with vs? Can wee iuſtly excuſe our ſelues, and ſay, The cauſe of our not weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is the want of cauſe to weepe, for that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, the commandements of God are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently kept, ſo as there is no iuſt reaſon of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vp Fountaines of teares, to bewaile the contrarie? Are we able in truth to defend our ſelues with this Apologie, which were the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly due Apologie, that would defend vs from blame for not weeping? I would to God, euen hartily I would, that it were ſo, and that it were nothing but our, either too much zeale, or too much aptneſſe to find fault, that made vs in this manner to accuſe and condemne our ſelues, and you. But alaſſe, the contrary is moſt manifeſt and vndeniable. Sinne aboundeth with vs as much, as euer it did (I thinke) in the ſtreetes of Ieruſalem; and (as it is fore-prophecyed, that knowledge ſhould, ſo it is fulfilled, that) wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doth euen ouerflow, like the waues of the Sea. Oathes, and blaſphemies, and curſed ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, breaking of the Lords day, &amp; vnhallowed
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:8041:127"/>profanation of Gods hallowed Time, contempt of Gods Word and Ordinances, and a ſhamefull turning of Religion into a meere forme &amp; faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, diſobedience againſt Gouernours, murder, whoredome, theft, fraud, vſurie, briberie, ſimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, all ſinnes, almoſt, of all ſorts, in all eſtates, all places, all ages, all conditions, all ſexes, doe ſwarme round about, and fill the World, like the Frogs of Egypt, or the Flyes. The face of our Nation is couered ouer with a Leproſie and Tetter, of moſt odious and loathſome wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Who can walke the ſtreetes in a Market, or a Faire-day, and not heare a thouſand oathes, and a thouſand curſes, a thouſand lyes, and a thouſand periuries, euen wilfull and groſſe falſe ſwearing, euen for a very trifle? With vs they deſpiſe Father and Mother; with vs they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the poore and fatherleſſe; with vs, they defile euery man his neighbours wife; and with vs, they take vſurie, and lend for encreaſe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, there is lying, ſwearing, whoring, ſtealing, killing, and in a manner, no mercy, nor truth, nor knowledge, nor feare of God in the Land: ſo that it is nothing elſe but very blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that makes vs not to ſee, if we ſee not, our Countrie to be euen buried almoſt, in a Sea of wickedneſſe, and yet loe, wee weepe not, nor mourne; our dead hearts and drie eyes drop downe no teares for all this. O blockiſh and ſenceleſſe ſoules of ours! O conſciences harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and deaded, and little leſſe then ſeared with an hot Yron! O that wee could bee greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:8041:128"/>with our ſelues, for hauing been ſo exceeding hard-harted this way, and for hauing beſtowed ſo little time and paines in labouring, to make our ſelues ſofter. We haue not onely not wept, but not ſtriuen to weepe, not alone haue we omitted ſorrow, but euen the endeauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after ſorrow hath been farre from vs, and that of the two is the much more faultie; for he that labours to performe a Chriſtian dutie, and yet failkes of it, for all his labour, is a farre leſſe offender, then he that doth vtterly forbeare all paines to performe it. Now ſo it is with moſt of vs (I thinke, I may ſay with moſt of vs) wee haue beſtowed no paines, nor time, to digge vp theſe fountaines of teares, we haue not ſet our thoughts that way, nor laboured the matter with our owne hearts, to make them grieued and ſorrowfull in this behalfe. Againe, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine therefore, let vs compare our ſelues with this Prophet, and wonder at the difference, that he had floods of teares, and we haue ſcarce at all one teare, to ſhed for the breach of Gods Law, which is ſo notoriouſly broken amongſt vs. There is, I acknowledge, a generation of fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finding men, that make vs farre worſe then wee be, their ſharpe-ſighted eyes can ſee no lawfull Miniſtry, no true Word, Church, Sacraments, nor prayer amongſt vs, and yet of theſe capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous People, and carping Nation, that ouerlaſh ſo much in accuſing, there is ſcarce any that mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth for the things hee carpeth at: for they ſo ſpend themſelues in falſe accuſing, that they
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:8041:128"/>haue no leaſure to beſtow in true bewailing of our ſinnes. But tho wee may not, nor muſt not acknowledge our ſelues ſo bad as they would make vs (for a body may liue, tho he be ſicke and diſeaſed; and <hi>Iob</hi> was a true and liuing man, tho couered ouer from head to foote with boyles and Vlcers, that his friends knew him not,) yet neither can wee deny our ſelues to bee a people very wicked and diſordered, to whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets words may fitly bee applied; <hi>Ah ſinfull Nation! Ah people laden with wickedneſſe, a corrupt Seede.</hi> And againe; <hi>We haue deepely reuolted from the Lord, and our ſinnes are gone ouer our heads, and they reach vp to Heauen.</hi> And in another ſenſe we may ſay as he; <hi>The whole head is ſicke, the whole heart is heauy, from the crowne of the head, to the ſoles of the feete, there is little to be ſeene but wounds, and ſwellings;</hi> and yet, ah yet, we lament not; thoſe that feare God, lament not; thoſe that come to Church, and loue the Word, lament not; thoſe that deſire otherwiſe to walke vprightly and conſcionably, lament not; ſo that it may wel be a queſtion, whether moſt of vs euer read this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, or heard it read with any conſideration and aduiſement. If the eyes of ſinners were only found drie, if teares were abſent alone from the cheekes of thoſe that work wickedneſſe, it were not much: who could expect any thing but ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie hardneſſe, from ſtony-hearted men? But euen the people of God, his owne children, that ſhould haue hearts of fleſh within them, theſe alſo haue continued hard, in regard of other
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:8041:129"/>mens faults, and euen forgotten that it is a dutie, to make Riuers of waters deſcend from their eyes, becauſe men keep not Gods ſtatutes. Now Brethren, if this were a fruit of a kind of naturall vnfitneſſe to mourne, becauſe we were made of a firmer mettle, then that ſorrow could melt vs: we might then lay the blame vpon the body, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the mind. And yet if nature had denied vs teares, it hath not denied vs ſighs, &amp; groanes, it hath not denied vs the power of ſitting in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, and of making our ſelues ſad and penſiue. Though wee could not weepe ſo plentifully as this Prophet, yet we might end our hearts, and earne in our bowels, and ake within, and ſigh, and grind our very ſoules to powder, which yet alas wee neither doe, nor ſtriue to doe. As the outward demonſtrations of ſorrow, I meane, wet eyes, are abſent from vs, ſo is alſo the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance thereof, I meane, the inward tumbling of the ſoule vp and downe diſquietly, the hearts beating it ſelfe, as it were, againſt it ſelfe, and cauſing it ſelfe to be pained. So then we neither mourne outwardly, nor yet inwardly; wee nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weepe with our eyes, nor grieue with our hearts; and what can wee ſay in our owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence? For certainely, brethren, it is not the want of aptneſſe to weepe, that makes vs not to weepe, for our eyes are ready enough in other caſes, and for other matters, to yeeld forth euen Riuers of waters. Let but an husband, or wife, or child, or friend lye ſicke, and be ready to die; let but fire come and conſume ſome part of our
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:8041:129"/>goods; let any man but coozen and deceiue vs of ſome ſummes of money; yea, let any friend ſhew himſelfe vnkind, and diſreſpectfull of vs; yea, let any enemy reproch vs with froward and bitter ſpeeches; yea, let a Gouernour chide and ſhent vs, as we thinke, without our fault; or but an equall take vs vp ouer-cuttedly in termes, or any, almoſt, the leaſt thing befal, that wrongs vs, in body, goods, or name: O then how we melt like waxe before the fire? What flood-gates be our eyes? How do teares puſh themſelues for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (like a breach of the ſea) and will not bee ſtopped? Then we cannot ſpeak, but we weepe, and ſob, and hardly can ſpeake for weeping. O fooliſh man and vnwiſe! Canſt thou haue while and heart to weepe ſo much for the evuill words ſpoken againſt thee, for the diſcourteſies offred vnto thee, for the loſſes and croſſes that do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall thee, and canſt thou not weepe at all for the ſinnes committed againſt God, for the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands and ten thouſands of oathes, and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that are darted at his Name, for the wofull ſacrilege committed againſt his Church, for the ignorance, blindneſſe, hypocriſie, profanenes of the multitude, and in a word, for all the number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe abominations, that are daily, hourely, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely committed amongſt vs? O heart poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſelfe-loue, and prizing its owne eaſe and welfare aboue Gods honour and glory, and making more account of its ſelf, then of its Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker! Here now if in any thing we ſhould enlarge our ſelues, in ſpeaking againſt our ſelues, and in
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:8041:130"/>reproouing, ſhaming, condemning our ſelues; and this, if any thing, we ſhould moſt vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſſe vpon our ſelues, as an extreme and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſweerable aggrauation of our hardneſſe, which by this we know, not to be naturall, but ſinfull. Say to thy ſelfe, I came to ſuch a place, ſuch a time, and found the countenance of my parent, brother, ſiſter, or friend, eſtranged from me; and his words and carriages vnlouing towards me: It put me in my dumps for a day or two after, and made mee water my plants, and moyſten mine hands and handkerchiefe with teares. I went, not long after, into another place, and heard fortie foule oathes, and a number of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible execrations and raylings, and one or two drie ſighes ſerued the turne at this wickedneſſe, or ſcarce ſo much was done by me, to ſhew my ſorrow. O Lord, O Lord, how aboundeth mine heart with ouer-high conceits of my ſelfe? How doe I ouer-value my ſelf, and vnder-value thee? What, to be more troubled at a croſſe word or two againſt my ſelfe, at the denying of ſome ſmall requeſt, at any diſcourteſie, any iniury, then at ſo many oathes, lyes, curſes, raylings, as I haue heard without trouble? I know not whether I ſhould be more aſhamed of mine exceſſiuenes of teares in the one caſe, or my defectiueneſſe in the other; but both layd together, doe make vp the meaſure of mine hardheartedneſſe to the full. If I could ſigh, mourne, weepe for nothing, it were not ſo much, that I did it not for the ſinnes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but when I haue ſuch ſtore of teares for
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:8041:130"/>other things, now to be ſo ſcant of them for that that deſerueth the farre greater quantitie, what ſhall I ſay of my ſelfe? Sure this deſerues a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſorrow, beyond teares, and ſo fall vpon thine owne heart, and cruſh it too pieces with diſlike of thy ſelfe, that haſt been ſo extremely iſenſible in Gods behalfe, ſo ouer-tender in thine owne. O that theſe words of mine might ſo farre preuaile with my ſelfe and you, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that wee may at leaſtwiſe acknowledge our ſelues to bee greatly faultie, for not hauing diſcouered our deteſtation of ſinne, our good will to God and Man, our religious care of the publike welfare and our owne, by taking out the leſſon of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> and by following the worthy patterne of holy <hi>Ezra,</hi> and bleſſed <hi>Paul</hi> and our moſt bleſſed and worthy Sauiour himſelfe. Doubtleſſe it will doe ſome good, to know our ſinnes, and to confeſſe againſt our ſelues, ſaying, I am in truth exceedingly oo blame, for my lauiſh and prodigall caſting away ſuch a multitude of teares for nothing, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing ſo very few or none in that caſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they would haue been (as precious ſeed in a good ground) exceeding profitable to my ſelfe and others, I meane, in bewailing the ſinnes both of my ſelfe and of the times.</p>

Ignorance of a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie required, though it cannot wholly excuſe the neglect of it, is yet ſome mitigation of the fault: but when a man is plainely told of a dutie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced that it is a dutie, reprooued for omitting it, and yet is careleſſe to performe it, now his careleſneſſe is notorious and inexcuſable. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, my Brethren, ſome of you that haue now been taught the needfulneſſe of theſe teares, did neuer conſider the matter ſo well before, but now that the thing is made plaine vnto you; and your ſoules muſt needs confeſſe, that you alſo, as well as <hi>Dauid,</hi> ought to be mooued with the faults of others: continue not to omit a knowne dutie, leſt your conſciences accuſe you of wilfull diſobedience. Not alone to doe what God forbids me, when I know his will to the contrarie, is a fruite of wilfulneſſe; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to neglect what hee enioynes, when his good pleaſure is made manifeſt vnto me.</p>
                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:8041:131"/>
                     <p>Wee haue taken from you the excuſe of ignorance; wee haue made your hearts to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that you ought to haue wept ſome of <hi>Dauids</hi> teares: wee haue, I hope, made you ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull for not weeping them; now, wee pray you, let vs make you carefull, to ſhed theſe teares more plentifully hereafter. I know, that the ſame <hi>Dauid</hi> that here tels of riuers of teares, doth alſo tell of his ſongs in the night, and great reioycing. But there is no ſuch oppoſition or fewd betwixt ſuch ſongs, and ſuch teares, that both may not well be done in their ſeaſons. The day is long enough for both, at leaſt, our life is long enough, and euerie Chriſtian muſt find while to mourne for his owne and others faults, that he may be comforted: he muſt ſometimes make his teares his drinke, that he may be fitted for the cup of conſolation; and put himſelfe in aſhes, that hee may be ready to receiue the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of gladneſſe. Wherefore, brethren, frame your ſelues to mourning and lamentation, lift vp your voyces, and weepe, and draw forth wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and powre it out here before the Lord, for an acceptable drinke-offering, as once it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of the people in the dayes of <hi>Samuel:</hi> A fitter ſeaſon to mourne, wee need not ſeeke for. The Text fits well with the time. Oh that our harts would fit with both! God hath mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, wil not ye mourne? Be not among the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of men, that mourne not when they are wept vnto; we come now to tell you, that God would haue you weepe. He calls for your teares,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:8041:132"/>and he lookes for them: and let him not looke in vaine. Take vp the words of the Prophet, and ſay; <hi>O that our heads were Fountaines, and our eyes Well-ſprings of teares, that wee might weepe day and night, for the ſinnes of the Daughters of our People!</hi> Yea, let euery man ſay with him; <hi>My belly, my belly, depart from me, comfort me not, looke away from me, for I will weepe bitterly, becauſe</hi> (not of the ſlaine, but) <hi>of the ſinnes of the Daughter of my People:</hi> for it is a day of wickedneſſe and abomination, and a time of extreme diſſoluteneſſe. My bowels, my bowels, I am pained at the heart; I cannot hold my peace, mine heart makes a noyſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me; for I haue heard the voyce of ſwearing and curſing, ſinne vpon ſinne, iniquitie vpon ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie; the people is a fooliſh people, they haue not knowne God, they are ſottiſh children, and will receiue no inſtruction; they are wiſe to doe eiull, but to doe good they haue no knowledge. Imitate the good Prophet in theſe words of his, and labour to put on his affections, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede more particularly, and ſay: Oh the oathes and blaſphemies in our Nation! O, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Gods Word and Goſpell in our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! O, the pride and idleneſſe in our Nation! O, the drunkenneſſe, whoredome, and filthineſſe in our Nation! If Rome, or Conſtantinople a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded with ſwearing and curſing, who could looke for better there? If France and Italy were full of whoredomes, who could expect other in thoſe corners of Popiſh darkeneſſe? But Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Ah England! Gods Signet, Gods Iewell,

England, the one onely Nation, almoſt, that doth openly and ſolely profeſſe the true Religion of God: I ſay, England aboundeth in all theſe ſinnes. What ſhall we ſay or doe? Whither ſhall we turne our ſelues? And how ſhall we comfort our ſelues for this, when euen England is full of all wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe? What? Swearing in England?

Euen in England, where there is ſo much preaching, and ſo much hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring? Where the Goſpell hath baniſhed Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for ſo many yeeres? Where the Scriptures haue ſo long time been read and publiſhed, and where God hath vſed ſo many meanes for ſo great ſpace of time to recall vs? O, breake our hearts within vs, and let our eyes drop downe teares to thinke of it! But what meane I thus to ſtriue with you for teares, and to wreſt and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort them out of your heads by force? To weepe a little at a Sermon, is nothing to ſpeak of: there is a further matter required of you. In ſecret, I ſay, in ſecret, when you bee all alone, and may more freely doe it, then doe it more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; or elſe to doe it here a little by compulſion of earneſt words &amp; perſwaſions, is little worth, and will doe little good. I confeſſe, that in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating theſe things with my ſelf, I found mine eyes great with teares, and mine heart within

But, ah, there is yet a greater and ſecreter mourning which I call you to. <hi>He weepes in truth, that weepes without witneſſe.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Trepare to the worke.</note> Take thou ſome time this day, or ſome other day, to get alone by thy ſelfe, and preſſe theſe things vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy ſelf, that haue bin ſo earneſtly beaten vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee in the preaching of the Word; and there bowing the knees of thy ſoule before God, begin with an acknowledgment vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, that now thou confeſſeſt this mourning: for the publike ſins is a duty, which he doth iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly require at thine hands, &amp; which thou haſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully neglected heretofore, but now art ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for that neglect, and deſirous to performe hereafter; and then humbly beſeech him to thaw, by the ſweete and warme beames of his Grace, this frozen heart of thine, and ſo to ſmite this rockie ſoule, that it may yeeld forth, as once the naturall Rocke did, euen Riuers of water. Pray him, according to his moſt free and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſe, to powre vpon thee the Spirit of Grace and ſupplication, and remouing the heart of ſtone, to put within thee, in ſtead of it, an hart of fleſh, that thou mayſt now doe, what <hi>Dauid</hi> did, and what thy ſelfe by his example art called vpon by the Miniſtrie (and art accordingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous) to doe.</p>

Thinke and ſay thus then to thy ſelfe in thy meditations: Ah, what a vile and wretched ſinner am I? What a Childhood haue I ſpent? What an Youth? What a Middle-age? And (if thou beeſt come ſo farre) what an Old-age? What thoughts haue I harboured in mine heart? What words haue I vttered with my tongue? What deeds haue I done with mine hand? This tongue of mine hath ſworne many a vaine, paſſionate, and outragious oath: This tongue hath curſed, and rayled, and ſpoken profanely: It hath ſpoken wantonly and filthily, and told many a lye and falſe tale. This hand hath vſed cruelty, reuenge and dalliance. This heart hath ſwolne againſt Gouernours, and boyled away in enuy and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. This heart hath been feareleſſe and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of God, and hath forgotten him and his Word, and euen doubted of his Beeing. O wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched tongue, wretched hand, &amp; wretched hart! O, would that I could mourne for all theſe abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of my life! O, that all the teares which euer I wept in all my life, for croſſes, loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, wrongs, iniuries, vnkindneſſes, and the like, were now all vnwept, and gathered together at once in mine eyes, that I might powre them forth in godly ſorrow before the Lord for my ſinnes! Be thou humbled and caſt downe, O my ſoule, and be thou troubled within me! wallow thy ſelfe in the duſt, and tumble thy ſelf in aſhes.
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:8041:134"/>Thou haſt offended againſt thy Maker, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt thy Redeemer, the holy Sonne of God! Thou haſt wronged thy neighbours, and hurt thy ſelfe, and deſerued damnation; and, Ah wretch, thou haſt ſhewed thy ſelfe vngracious and vngratefull, againſt that heauenly, carefull, and tender-hearted Father, that gaue his onely Sonne to death to ranſome thee. What Father euer ſo louing? What child euer ſo rebellious? Why are you drie, O mine eyes? And why art thou ſtony, O mine heart? Why doth ſorrow flie from mee? And why are teares departed hence?

He muſt hiſſe for his Flie againſt vs, &amp; bring vpon vs, as he threatned and brought vpon Iudah, his foure great Armies to deſtroy, Sword, Famine, Peſtilence, and the teeth of euill beaſts to deuoure.

And now thinke with thy ſelfe, that thou beholdeſt God, ſending ſcarceneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, and euery body feeble and languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Thinke that thou ſaweſt the Peſtilence lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in at our houſes, and ſweeping away whole Families and Townes, till there bee no buyer.

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:8041:136"/>and when the generation of mourners for ſinne is gone, then will the time of howling for the puniſhment of ſinne be here.

But alack, I feare you wil not, I feare we looſe our labour. Buſineſſe, buſineſſe, ſports, paſtime, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, ſome one or other ſuch thing, will ſteale your hearts away, I feare: for ſo it is vſually ſeene, out of the Church, into

Now for the Lord Ieſus ſake, doe not ſo this day, but couenant with thy ſelfe, that afore thou ſleepeſt, thou wilt forcibly breake thorow all occaſions, and find ſome one houre to take paines with thine heart, and to frame it to ſome tenderneſſe of remorſe, that thou mayſt be able once to ſay with <hi>Dauid; Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of waters haue runne downe mine eyes, becauſe they kept not thy Law.</hi> Say, thou ſhouldeſt heare of the death of wife, husband, child, friend: would it not affect thine hart with ſome ſorrow? Let the tidings, yea, the hearing &amp; beholding of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſinnes committed (which doe more diſhonor God, then any croſſe can hurt thee) haue ſome power ouer thy griefes, and ſhew, that thine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are not altogether carnall. One or two teares, ſhed for ſinne voluntarily, in the day of proſperitie, out of a ture deſire to ſhew our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of it, and loue to God; and out of a ſerious conſideration of its ſpiritual filthineſſe, and hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſſe, is more worth, then twenty teares ſhed in the day of affliction, when a man cannot tell, whether it bee the ſinne or the croſſe that procures his teares. Now therefore addreſſe your ſelues to that vnwelcome taske of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (to Nature, I ſay, vnwelcome, but to Grace

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:8041:138"/>liues. Thou knoweſt, <hi>Dauid</hi> was a child of God, a true regenerate man, a man after Gods owne heart; thou knoweſt, hee had all his ſinnes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, dyed an happy death, now reigneth in Heauen, and hath attained eternall ſaluation. It would doe thine heart good, to haue an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble token, that thou alſo art ſuch an one as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> that thou haſt intereſt into the ſame good things which he enioyeth, and ſhalt haue poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of them at laſt, as ſure as he hath.

He wept, and ſighed, and lamented, and cryed, and tooke on very pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, euen as if ſome great croſſe had befalne himſelfe, and as if his owne perſon had receiued harme. Canſt thou likewiſe affirme before the Lord, that the ſame cauſe hath produced in thee the ſame effects? Doth the breach of Gods Law breake thine heart? Doth the ſinfulneſſe of others make thy ſoule ſorrowfull? Doſt thou ſigh and groane, and bewaile, and mourne for thoſe things, which it is not in thy power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe? Loe then, thou art a <hi>Dauid,</hi> a man after Gods heart alſo, a ſound and ſincere Chriſtian, an Iſraelite within, before God, a louer of God, a louer of thy Brethren, an hater of ſin, and thou alſo ſhalt be ſaued with <hi>Dauid,</hi> and reioyce with the ſame heauenly Ioy, wherewith hee now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyceth. Thoſe that are like the Saints of God

Doſt thou mourne for the ſinnes of other men? Then will God looke vpon thee, and bee mercifull vnto thee, as he vſeth to doe to them, that loue his name; for thou alſo loueſt his name. Doth thine eye drop downe teares, becauſe men keepe not Gods Law? Then will he order thy ſteps in his Word, neither ſhall any iniquitie haue domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ouer thee. Doth thy ſoule lament bitterly the common ſinnes? Then will he deliuer thee from the oppreſſion of men, that thou mayeſt keepe his precepts? Doth thine heart mourne for the publike offences of thoſe, with whom thou liueſt? Then will God make his face to ſhine vpon thee his ſeruant, and will teach thee his Statutes. In a word; Striueſt thou to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme this ſeruice, of which, <hi>Dauid</hi> maketh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in this verſe?

                     <p>To mourne for the generall calamities of the Church,<note place="margin">Two ſure ſignes of sanctity.</note> when ones ſelfe is at peace; and to mourne for the generall ſinnes of the Church, though himſelfe bee free; theſe are two moſt happy ſignes of true holineſſe, and this latter I thinke to be the ſurer of the twaine, as more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly and manifeſtly teſtifying true zeale of Gods glory. Yea, whoſoeuer ſorrowes hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the common ſinnes, may, in ſome reſpect, take more ſure hold of that mourning to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme his faith, and aſſure himſelf of his vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, then of his ſorrowing for his owne parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular faults.

Is not <hi>Lot</hi> in Heauen? Is not <hi>Dauid</hi> in Heauen? Is not <hi>Ezra</hi> in Heauen? Ae not <hi>Ieremiah, Baruch, Ebedmelech,</hi> and the reſt of theſe mourners all in eternall glory in Heauen? Name me a man that is noted to haue bewailed the ſinnes of others, and I will bring you a ground out of Scripture without doubt or queſtion, that he is ſaued: ſo can it not bee ſaid of thoſe that haue mourned for their owne ſinnes. For in truth, the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of an euill conſcience, terrifying the ſoule with the feare of hell fire, may ſtirre vp ſuch griefe, and make an vnſanctified man complaine bitterly, that hee hath ſinned in ſuch or ſuch a thing, as <hi>Iudas</hi> in betraying innocent blood. That naturall affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which we beare vnto our ſelues, may alſo make vs ſorrowfull fort that, which we cannot but ſee, will bee harmefull to our ſelues, euen where no grace at all doth dwell: But to ſorrow for publike offences, and for the ſinnes of thoſe, that are no way neere vnto vs (but as the common bands of Humanitie and Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie haue vnited them) there can bee no motiue
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:8041:140"/>at all imagined, except the true hatred of ſinne, and the true loue of God and man, which no man can haue, but from the Spirit of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt dwelling in him. Deſperation and horror without Grace, may procure teares for ones owne faults, nothing but holineſſe can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them for others. A man may lament his owne ſinnes, and not hate them; hee cannot la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the common ſinnes, but out of an hatred of them. Wherefore let the people of God make much of theſe teares, and preſerue them (as it were ſome hot and comfortable licour) for their vſe, againſt the day of temptation; that when the weake faith ſhall bee aſſaulted with manifold obiections, it may haue this token of truth to alleage for it ſelfe, againſt which, there can bee none exception; and let the people of God endeuour to be frequent in this exerciſe o mourning for the common ſinnes, that they may abound in comfort afterwards, and be filled with ioy, in ſtead of ſorrow; for alwaies holy ſorrow ends in ioy. Wee may not make our ſelues ſo careleſſe of our ſpirituall eſtate, as to loſe a good dutie, but muſt put al the Graces that God hath giuen vs, and the effects of them to the beſt vſe, improouing them all to the encreaſe of our faith in God, and our ſpirituall reioycing in the aſſurance of his loue. It will make vs conſtant in good duties, if wee ſhall find them to doe vs much good. Let theſe ſorrowes be much profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and comfortable vnto them (O Chriſtian ſoule,) as indeed they ought, and out of theſe
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:8041:140"/>weeping promiſes, gather theſe gladſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions. I am ſure I am Gods child: I am ſure I am a member of the ſame body, that <hi>Dauid</hi> was a member of: I am ſure, I partake of that Spirit that dwelt in him: I am ſure, that ſinne ſhall not mortally infect me; that I ſhall not bee drowned in the publike Iudgements; that God will either ſpare the Land for the ſake of my ſelfe, and other like mourners; or at leaſt, that himſelfe will make prouiſion for my welfare in the common woes. I ſhall laugh, when others are puniſhed for ſin, becauſe I wept, when they committed ſinne. God will bee my ſhelter and refuge in the time of trouble, and hee will not giue me ouer to the deſtroyer; for often haue I cauſed, and often doe I purpoſe hereafter to cauſe, that ſtreames of teares ſhall deſcend from mine eyes, becauſe the ſonnes of men doe tread his Statutes vnder-foot. I haue not onely wept for mine owne ſinnes (which feare of ſhame in the World, or damnation in Hell, hath made many a diſſembler doe:) I haue not alone wept for the faults of my children, and neere friends (which alſo carnall affection hath made many a carnall man to do in ſome caſes:) I haue not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wept for the faults of others, that were harmefull to my ſelfe and my friends, (as ſelfe-loue wil make any man to doe,) but I haue wept for the generall ſinnes of the whole Land, for the ſinnes of the high and low, for the ſinnes of ſtrangers that knew mee not, and enemies that loue mee not; for the ſinnes of any of <hi>Adams</hi>
                        <pb n="262" facs="tcp:8041:141"/>ſonnes, that I knew to haue ſinned, becauſe they kept not Gods Precepts. Bleſſed be the Lord, that hath made maine heart, in ſuch a meaſure, ſoft and tender: I am in his Couenant, ſeeing he hath created an heart of fleſh within my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and I am ſure, that none but a fleſhy hart will make the eyes to ſhed teares, for the violation of Gods te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies by other men.</p>
